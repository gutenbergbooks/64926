  <h2 class='c008'>A COMMENTARY<br /> <br />UPON THE<br /> <br />PRECEDING OBJECTS OF INQUIRY:</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>With a view to appreciate and explain the relative
importance of each, in enabling the Medical Inquirer
and Jurist, to arrive at just conclusions, in cases of
complicated doubt and difficulty.</i></p>

<hr class='c007' />
<h3 id='case1' class='c011'>CASE I.<br /> <br />THE PATIENT IS LIVING, AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IS REQUIRED.</h3>

<p class='c012'>This is the least complicated case that can occur;
the medical inquirer has not only the advantage of
the patient’s testimony, but that also of his own observations
upon the symptoms and circumstances of
the case. We have already stated that the declaration
of a person, made under an apprehended pending
dissolution, is by the law of this realm considered
tantamount to an oath, (<i>see vol. i. p. 165</i>), and we
have also stated what it becomes our duty to repeat
in this place, that in recording such testimony, we
must be prepared to combat various errors and
prejudices: we do not mean to deny that the awful
situation in which the patient is placed will not, in
general, secure us against any wilful misrepresentation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>but we contend, that a person acting under the
influence of bodily suffering is very apt to fall into
numerous fallacies respecting the transactions in
which he may have been previously engaged; especially
in such cases as usually constitute the objects
of medico-judicial inquiry, where the passions not
unfrequently increase the natural disturbance of the
mind, while the eagerness which is so justly felt for
the detection of the author of the injury, will tend
rather to heighten than to correct any hallucinations
under which the sufferer may happen to labour; for
on such occasions the imagination is always ready to
supply the want of testimony, and to fill up the spaces
which actual observation may have left vacant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Patients have not unfrequently laboured under
the impression of their having taken poison, when
there can never have existed the least ground for
such a suspicion, and yet their general conduct has
been in complete opposition to the idea of insanity:<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
a curious case of this kind is related in the <i>Sepulchretum</i>
of Bonetus; and even during the progress of
the present work, the author was consulted upon an
illness, which the patient seriously attributed to the
operation of a slow poison, declaring that it had
been secretly administered during a philanthropic
visit to one of our public prisons. <i>Dr. Esquirol</i><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
also relates the case of a lady, twenty-seven years of
age, who in the last stage of phthisis pulmonalis perceived
in her room the odour of burning charcoal,
and immediately conceived that there was a design
against her life; in consequence of which she left her
lodging, and sought another abode, but the fumes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>incessantly pursued her, and she died fully convinced
that she was the victim of some malicious persecution.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of all the fallacies with which we have to
contend, no one is more dangerous in its effects, or
more frequent in its occurrence, than that which leads
them to mistake the identity of the offender; we have
already alluded to this fallacy (<i>vol.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 440), and we
shall hereafter have occasion to refer to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a medical practitioner is summoned to investigate
a case, in which severe sufferings have
supervened, without any apparent or assignable
cause, the following interrogatories are calculated to
elicit data for a just conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Previous state of the patient, with respect to bodily
health and strength?</i>—The knowledge of these facts
will materially assist us, not only in explaining the
violence of the present symptoms, but in estimating
their indications, in forming some opinion with regard
to their causes, and in prognosticating their results.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The age and occupation</i> are also to be ascertained.
Violent tormina of the bowels, and other symptoms
resembling those of acute poisoning, are frequently
explained at once, by learning that the individual in
question has been engaged in some trade or manufactory,
from which he has been necessarily exposed to
metallic exhalations; thus painters, gilders, smelters,
and others, from living almost constantly in an atmosphere
charged with such fumes, are always liable
to sudden and violent attacks, dreadful cholics, paralysis,
and premature death. <i>See our chapter on the
poison of Lead, vol. 2, p. 336, and that on Aerial Poisons,
page 457.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Present symptoms of the patient.</i>—Having gained
the necessary information with respect to the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>history of our patient, we are prepared to investigate
the symptoms under which he at present labours, and
to inquire into the circumstances of their accession,
progress, order of succession, intensity, and duration.
If this investigation be conducted with skill, we shall
be enabled to form some opinion respecting the origin
of the sufferings, and, perhaps, to distinguish the
invasion of a spontaneous disease from the effects of
acute poisoning: upon this latter point, however,
we shall require the aid of much collateral information,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
as <em>whether the patient has ever suffered in a
similar manner at any previous period, or whether
any part of his family or friends have experienced a
similar attack at the present time</em>? If the reply to
this latter query be in the affirmative, we may look
for a common cause of the complaint, and be led to
suspect that it may arise from the ingestion of some
acrid matter. We should therefore proceed to discover
<em>the nature of the meals last taken as to quantity
and quality</em>; the practitioner should, at the same
time, pay particular attention to the state of the
different persons affected, and to the existence or
absence of vomitings and stools. The following case,
reported by <i>Morgagni</i>, and quoted by <i>Orfila</i> &amp; <i>Foderé</i>,
may be introduced as affording good illustrations of
those points of inquiry, whose importance we are
anxious to enforce. “In the month of May, 1711,
four persons, that is to say, a priest, two women, one
of which was his sister-in-law, and another person,
all in good health, and on a journey, stopped at an
inn to dine. Setting out on their road after dinner,
the priest in a short time felt himself so ill in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>bowels, that he was obliged to dismount from his
horse. Notwithstanding the copious evacuations,
both upwards and downwards, the pain increased
every moment, and it was necessary to take the patient
back to Céserne, the place where they had
dined, and where the priest arrived half dead. A
medical man who was called in, thinking he had only
to deal with an ordinary cholic, employed a number
of fomentations, glysters, purgative draughts, and
anodynes; although he saw that one of the women
had also strong evacuations with pains and faintings,
and that the other person complained of pains and
of a weight at the stomach, he never suspected the
presence of a poison, because the other woman had
no complaint, and the landlord protested with many
imprecations, that there was nothing dangerous in his
dishes; however, the evacuations saved the patients,
and as they diminished a little next morning, it allowed
of their removing into the neighbourhood of
<i>Morgagni’s</i> residence, whom they immediately called
in. This great physician having ascertained whether
there was any dish at the table of which the woman
who was in good health had not eaten, and having
found that it was a great dish of rice which had been
first served up, concluded from this circumstance that
it was this dish that contained the poison. The difficulty
however, was, that the priest who had eaten
the least, and who had been on the whole extremely
abstemious, was precisely the person who had suffered
the most, and the soonest; that the woman, who
had eaten more than the priest, had been less sick
than he; and that the other person, who had eaten
more than all the rest, was the one who was the least
incommoded.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Was there no cheese rasped over this rice? demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><i>Morgagni</i>. They answered in the affirmative;
the priest who had little or no appetite, ate
scarcely any thing but the cheese. In that case, said
<i>Morgagni</i>, you understand already that there was
arsenic among that cheese, which had probably been
prepared for killing rats, and not having been laid
away with sufficient care, some one had taken it to
serve up with your rice during the time that you
were hurrying the landlord to send up your dinner.
These conjectures were verified by the confession of
the landlord himself, who, having learned that the
patients were out of danger, was no longer afraid to
acknowledge that such had been the cause of this unfortunate
accident.</p>

<p class='c000'>The practitioner, says <i>Orfila</i>, will not be able to
form a correct judgment in cases of this kind, if he
neglect to pay attention, <em>first</em>, to the state of the
stomach of the different persons poisoned; in fact,
those who have taken a great quantity of food or
drink, would feel in general less severe symptoms
than others; <em>second</em>, to the nature of the dishes and
of the drinks, as well as to the quantity that each
person may have eaten or drank; <em>third</em>, to the existence
or absence of vomitings and stools. It is evident
that it may happen, that some persons have
eaten a tolerably large quantity of a poisoned dish
without any serious symptoms taking place, for this
very reason, that the quantity of the food was considerable,
and that it easily produced copious evacuations,
by means of which the poison had been expelled.
Numerous cases of culinary poisoning might
be adduced in this place, in illustration of the important
lights which are to be derived from the investigations
which form the subject of the present chapter;
but we have already considered the subject very fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>under the head of poisons; and in the history of the
effects of copper and lead, we have particularly explained
the evils that may arise from the careless use
of such metallic utensils in cookery.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether any and what remedies have been used; by
whom recommended; and by whom administered?</i>—The
importance of this part of the enquiry is too
obvious to require explanation; we are to learn from
it whether the administration of the medicines might
not have accidentally contributed to the aggravation
of the symptoms they were designed to allay; suppose,
for instance, we were to be told that the patient
had resorted to copious libations of brandy to mitigate
the sufferings of the bowels, which were afterwards
found to depend upon <i>Enteritis</i>; the inference
is obvious—but in performing this part of our professional
duty, the greatest caution is necessary, and
we must take care that our own medical opinions do
not carry us to an unjustifiable extent in our reprehension
of the plan of treatment which has been pursued
by others; a striking instance of this want of
propriety occurred in the late celebrated trial of
<i>Donnell</i>, and was very properly denounced by the
court, (<i>see page 161 in the second volume, and Appendix,
p. <a href='#Page_a_304'>304</a></i>.) But there still remains another
reason why we should cautiously and attentively
examine any medicine that may have been administered,
and it would be right in the practitioner to
procure a portion of such medicine, with a view to its
future analysis; for it has happened that where the
assassin has supposed that his first dose would be
insufficient to effect his purpose, he has artfully insinuated
an additional dose in the medicines which are
administered for the relief of his victim, and thus
the hand, which is treacherously held out with promises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of succour, adds a stronger poison to the cup;
this occurred in the diabolical case of <i>Mary Bateman</i>,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
better known by the name of the Yorkshire
witch, who having poisoned a family with arsenic,
sent a jar of honey, mixed with corrosive sublimate,
<em>for their relief</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A knowledge of the nature of the medicines that
may have been taken, will also assist the chemist in
his examination of the matter vomited, as we have
fully explained under the history of Poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Appearance of the evacuations.</i>—This should always
be attended to, for although it can hardly afford, in
itself, a satisfactory indication, yet we have shewn,
in the course of our history of poisons, that it may
concur with the facts to heighten the probability of a
case. The chemist will also require them for examination.</p>

<h3 id='case2' class='c011'>CASE II.<br /> <br />THE PATIENT IS DEAD.—THE ATTENDANTS CAN FURNISH ONLY AN IMPERFECT ACCOUNT OF HIS DISSOLUTION.</h3>

<p class='c012'>In conformity with the plan upon which we have
arranged the objects of inquiry into the causes of
sudden sickness and death—that of beginning with
the most simple and plain, and passing in regular
gradation to the more complicated and obscure problems,
the present case, in which the patient is
dead, but the attendants are able to furnish some
history, however imperfect, very naturally constitutes
the connecting link between that in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>patient is living, and that in which the great avenues
of information are entirely closed upon us by the
death of the individual, and the total absence of all
direct testimony. The plan, therefore, upon which
the investigation of this case is to be conducted, is in
a great measure to be derived from the application
of those precepts which are contained in the other
cases; that relating to the examination of the attendants
being collected from the first, and all that
concerns the death, from the third.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, however, one object of inquiry which
may be mentioned in this place with peculiar propriety,
as the obscure and often erroneous evidence
which is given in cases of sudden death, during an
affray, renders it highly important to learn, <i>whether
the deceased had died during a paroxysm of passion</i>.
We have little doubt but that many persons have
been convicted of murder, where the death of the
individual in question, was the sole effect of the high
state of irritation in which he had been placed.
That life may be suddenly extinguished by the violent
impulse of passion we have already shewn under
the consideration of Syncope (p. <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>), and we are
farther prepared to assert that Apoplexy<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, and
other fatal diseases may also, in certain states of predisposition,
result from the same powerful cause;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>violent transports of the mind may likewise occasion
the return of any particular disease to which the
patient had been formerly subject, as epilepsy, and
other spasmodic diseases; they may likewise bring a
chronic disease at once to a fatal crisis, as we have
seen in the case related at page 29 of the 2d volume;
the fact has been also well illustrated by <i>Dr. Gordon
Smith</i>, in the case which occurred to a surgeon of his
acquaintance in one of the midland counties, of which
the following is an outline. “In the course of an
altercation between a man and his wife, the woman
died, and a clamour was raised that the husband had
murdered her: an inquest being held, a verdict was
returned against him, and he stood his trial at the
following assizes; he was, however, acquitted, for it
appeared in evidence that he had not even touched
his wife during the quarrel. The deceased was a
person of an extremely violent temper, and on opening
her body, it was found that she had been labouring
under suppuration of the liver, and that an
abscess had burst into the cavity of the abdomen, in
consequence of the agitation into which she had been
thrown.” <i>Baron Larey</i> describes the case of a person
who had been violently wounded in the thorax
by a sword in a duel; but the man was progressively
recovering, when in the fourth month from the period
of the injury, he died suddenly in consequence of a
violent fit of anger; upon dissection, the heart and
pericardium exhibited traces of inflammation. We
should also learn, if possible, <i>whether the deceased had
been at the time of death in a state of intoxication</i>:
for in such a condition a comparatively slight injury
may occasion death. The following case, related by
<i>Dr. Cheyne</i>, in which <i>Mr. Charles Bell</i> was concerned,
we quote from <i>Mr. Shaw’s</i> excellent <i>Manual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of Anatomy</i><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, (p. 165.) “An industrious man returning
home from his work, found his house
empty; the bed he was to lie upon, and the tools
of his trade, sold for liquor by his wife, whom he
found in a gin shop, where she had been drinking
and dancing. He brought her home, and in the
passage of his house struck her, and ordered her to
go up stairs; she refused to go; he carried her upon
his shoulders, and the contention continuing up stairs,
he struck her again. There having been no one
present, we have only the husband’s account of her
death. He said that whilst sitting on her chair, she
fell down, upon which he threw her on the bed, conceiving
that she was in a fit, such as he had seen her
in formerly. Some of her neighbours coming in,
found her dead. <i>Mr. C. Bell</i> was requested to examine
the body of this woman. The man was afterwards
tried at the Old Bailey, for murder, when <i>Mr.
Bell</i> deposed, that upon taking out the brain, and
tracing the vessels in the base, the anterior artery
of the cerebrum going off from the internal carotid
of the left side, was found torn half way across. The
cause of this woman’s death was the bursting of the
blood from the ruptured vessel; as to the cause of
the rupture, <i>Mr. Bell’s</i> opinion coincided with the
best authorities in pathology, that there is a state of
the vessels, in which an external injury or shock is
more apt to produce rupture; and drunkenness may
be supposed to be the artificial state of excitement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>which most resembles this state of the vessels.
Being asked whether the blows were the cause of
the rupture, he said he conceived it very likely that
a shock would rupture the vessel; and being then
asked whether he conceived that this woman was
more likely to have a vessel ruptured, from having
<a id='bee'></a>been intoxicated—he was of opinion that intoxication,
and the struggle, were likely to produce such a
degree of activity of the circulation in the head, that
a less violent blow might produce rupture, than
what, in other circumstances, would have proved
fatal.” The prisoner was acquitted.—At the York
assizes in the year 1820, a somewhat analogous
question arose,—whether the deceased might not
have been attacked with apoplexy during the struggle?
The light of anatomical dissection will be required
in such a case, and the remarks which Mr.
<i>Shaw</i> has offered upon the subject, appear to us to
be extremely judicious and valuable; if, says he,
effusion of blood be found between the dura mater
and scull, and if a bruise on the scalp corresponds to
the part, we may conclude that it has been caused by
the blow; but if blood is found between the dura
mater and the brain, though we should discover the
marks of blows, or even fracture of the scull, still the
question may be entertained whether the patient
might not have been attacked with apoplexy during
the struggle.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>How soon is the deceased supposed to have died,
after the alleged cause of his dissolution.</i>—This is a very
important question, for by learning the length of the
interval between the attack and the death, we shall
at once be enabled to accept as probable, or reject
as impossible, the accounts given by the friends and
neighbours. Thus, poisons, in general, require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>some time for their operation. Apoplexy does not
generally destroy life under several hours<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 id='case3' class='c011'>CASE III.<br /> <br />THE PERSON IS FOUND DEAD, AND THE HISTORY OF HIS DISSOLUTION IS UNKNOWN.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The deep obscurity in which this case is necessarily
involved, can alone be dissipated by the concentrated
light of circumstantial evidence, derived from
the inspection of the dead body, in the exact situation
and posture in which it was found, and that of
the surrounding objects; from the information afforded
by competent witnesses, respecting the previous
history of the individual in question; and, lastly,
from anatomical dissection.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conducting such an inquiry the most trifling incidents
connected with the deceased should not pass
unheeded, for however unimportant they may at first,
individually, appear, we shall often find that in combination
they will afford the principal data for the
solution of our problem. With how many examples
will the history of crime present us where the more
minute circumstances have alone furnished the “damning
proofs” of guilt? Their apparent insignificance
in such cases would seem to exempt them even from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the usual precautions of concealment, and more especially
from those artful measures by which the designing
assassin seeks to cast an impenetrable veil
over the more direct evidences of his crime.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>1. <i>Circumstances to be learnt by the Inspection of the Body.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>That the inspection of the body could furnish the
satisfactory means of discovering the cause of its
death, is an opinion which has been very naturally
entertained from the earliest ages; although it is easy
to perceive that the extent and just value of the indications,
which such a practice is capable of affording,
could never have been appreciated until the
more advanced periods of physiological knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the ancients exposed their sick on the high
roads, for the advantage of receiving from the casual
passenger his opinion and experience respecting the
particular malady under which they laboured, so did
they expose the bodies of persons, supposed to have
been murdered, in order that each spectator might
candidly observe their appearance, and freely inquire
into the circumstances which attended their decease;
thus, as we are informed by <i>Pliny</i>, was the
body of <i>Genucius</i>, a tribune of the Roman people,
on his being found dead in bed, brought forth to the
assembled multitude, who, unable to discover any
external marks of violence, pronounced his death to
have been a visitation of the gods; and we learn
from <i>Tacitus</i>, that the remains of <i>Germanicus</i>, who
was poisoned by <i>Piso</i>, were exposed in the market
place of Antioch; thus too, in conformity with ancient
custom, was the bleeding corpse of <i>Julius
Cæsar</i> exposed to public gaze and animadversion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The decisions, however, which such a custom was
intended to facilitate, were generally perverted by
the delusions of credulity and superstition. Among
the more prominent instances of the latter source of
fallacy, we may notice a belief that has extended even
into later days—that upon the presence of the murderer
the wounds of his victim will bleed afresh!</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Situation and attitude of the body.</i>—It cannot be too
generally known that, upon the discovery of a dead
body, its situation and attitude should never be
disturbed until it has been examined by competent
persons. The information which the medical inquirer
may obtain from his observations upon the position
of the dead body, is often important and decisive; it
may even, in some cases, furnish data for determining
whether the death was occasioned by accident,
suicide, or murder. We may, for example, find the
deceased in a posture which he could never have himself
assumed, whence we should be led to conclude
that he had not fallen by his own hands. In the case
of the disputed suicide of the <i>Earl of Essex</i><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>tower, much information was lost by the body having
been stripped and removed before a due examination
took place; the hasty manner in which this
was performed, excited on that, as it necessarily
must on all similar occasions, very considerable suspicion
respecting the motives which could prompt so
premature and unnecessary an interference. An
attention to the posture of the body is also important
in cases of wounds, which should always be examined
with reference to this circumstance. It has also been
very justly observed, that a person in a fit, or in a
state of intoxication, might fall accidentally into such
a posture, as to be actually suffocated by the pressure
of his own hand, or that of any resisting body upon
his throat. If such a case were to occur, all evidence
of the fact would be destroyed by any officious interference
that might change the exact posture in
which the body was found.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>General appearance of the countenance, as to colour,
vascular turgescence, or congestion, and morbid physiognomy.</i>—The
observation of the countenance of a
deceased person will very frequently furnish the medical
inquirer with a useful hint in the investigation; we
have, for instance, already spoken of the expressive
physiognomy of a strangled person, (<i>page</i> <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>) and in
the course of our work, the reader will find ample
illustrations of the general importance of the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether any discharge issues from the mouth, nostrils,
ears, or any other orifice.</i>—The appearance of
froth about the mouth indicates that the death of the
person has not been instantaneous, but sudden, either
from apoplexy, epilepsy, or any other violent cause,
<i>see Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_a_273'>273</a>. In drowned persons the mouth
and nostrils are covered with foam. In epileptic paroxysms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>there is sometimes an involuntary discharge
of fæces, urine, and semen; the evacuation of the
fæces very generally occurs in cases of strangulation,
and sometimes in those of apoplexy. The appearance
of blood flowing from the ears would indicate a
violent death from some external cause.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Apparent age of the deceased.</i>—It is important to
notice this circumstance, as it will not only assist us
in identifying the individual, but, at the same time,
point out the diseases of which he was most susceptible,
and those of which he was less liable. In relation to
such an object the question of age was keenly debated
on the trial of <i>Donellan</i>, for an account of which we
must refer the reader to the evidence printed in the
<i>Appendix</i>. Apoplexy rarely occurs except in the
middle or decline of life. <i>Hippocrates</i> says chiefly
between the 40th and 50th year. <i>Aphor.</i> <i>Sect.</i> vi, 57.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Description of his person, as to bulk, stature, obesity,
muscular powers, &amp;c.</i>—Many are the reasons which
render a full and accurate investigation of these
points an extremely important part of the inquiry.
To say nothing of their use in identifying the individual,
they will point out the diseases to which such
a habit of body would render him liable; and we
shall be enabled to deduce a general inference as to
the probable state of his health. If suspicions should
exist against any individual, we shall be thus prepared
to arrive at some probable conclusion with regard
to the degree of resistance which the deceased
might be able to offer; by comparing which with
the powers of the supposed assailant, some valuable
circumstantial evidence may be elicited.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Conformation of the neck as to shortness, thickness,
&amp;c.</i>—The apoplectic conformation may be said to be
indicated by a large head, red face, short and thick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>neck, broad shoulders, capacious thorax, prominent
abdomen, low stature, robust limbs, and considerable
corpulence; this last indication, however, is
liable to many exceptions, for dry and spare constitutions,
if any confidence is to be placed in the comparative
tables of <i>Rochoux</i>, are more frequently even
attacked with apoplexy, than the plethoric. Under
this subject we may notice that the habitual use of
tight ligatures disposes to the disease. <i>Portal</i> speaks
of an ambassador who was attacked with apoplexy,
after having long employed general compression, for
the reduction of excessive corpulence. <i>Dr. Donald
Monro</i> states that he has known soldiers carried off
by apoplexy, in consequence of stricture on the veins
of the neck, from their having been obliged to wear
their cravats too tight. <i>Winslow</i> has made a similar
observation in the Memoirs of the Academy of
Sciences for the year 1741.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Probable period that has elapsed since the extinction
of life.</i>—Before the process of putrefaction has commenced,
we can only adduce an opinion upon this
subject from the circumstance of the coldness, rigidity,
and general complexion of the body. Under
ordinary circumstances, the body looses its vital heat
in a very short space of time, and cadaverous<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
stiffness takes place and continues until relaxed by
the progress of putrefaction; but there are many circumstances
that appear capable of controlling and
modifying this general result; the heat of the body
is not only abstracted with very different degrees of
celerity in different situations, but even in the same
situation, in death from different causes. <i>Portal</i>
and other physiologists have observed, that after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>death from apoplexy, the temperature of the body is
frequently maintained, even above the natural standard,
to a period beyond that in which it would be
totally abstracted from an inanimate mass under other
circumstances.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> It has been laid down as a general
rule, that the more sudden the death, the longer
is cadaverous stiffness from taking place, <i>M. Orfila</i>
also states, that if the body of a person suffocated,
either by a non-respirable gas, or by strangulation,
be cold or stiff, we may be certain that more than
twelve hours have elapsed since the fatal event, for
in death by such causes, the heat of the body is preserved
for at least that period; this statement is corroborated
by <i>Richerand</i>, who says that in asphyxia
from carbonic acid, the blood preserves its fluidity,
the limbs their flexibility, and the body its natural
heat for some hours after death. When the process
of putrefaction has established itself, we must deduce
our conclusions from the extent of its progress,
always taking into consideration the collateral circumstances
which may have operated in retarding or
accelerating its developement, such as the state of
the atmosphere in relation to temperature and humidity,
the particular circumstances of the spot in
which the body was found, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The determining, as accurately as possible, the
length of time the individual has been dead, is not
only important in cases of murder; it may be highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>essential to the ends of justice in questions of survivorship;
the following curious case, cited by <i>Dr.
Male</i>,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> will not only serve to substantiate this
assertion, but it will, at the same time, afford a triumphant
instance of the application of chemical
science in promoting the due administration of the
laws. It is well known that when dead animal fibre
is exposed, for a certain period, to the action of a
current of water, it becomes converted into a fatty
substance, resembling spermaceti, and known to chemists
under the name of <i>adipocire</i>. The period of
time required to effect this change has been the subject
of dispute. At the Lent assizes held at Warwick,
in the year 1805, a cause was tried, in which a
gentleman, who was insolvent, left his own house
with the intention, as it was presumed from his preceding
conduct and conversation, of destroying himself.
Five weeks and four days after that period, his
body was found floating down a river. The face was
disfigured by putrefaction, and the hair separated
from the scalp by the slightest pull; but the other
parts of the body were firm and white, without any
putrefactive appearance. The clothes were unaltered,
but the linen was exceedingly rotten. On examining
the body, it was found that several parts of it
were converted into <i>adipocire</i>. A commission of
bankruptcy having been taken out against the deceased
a few days <em>after</em> he had left his home, it became
a question of great importance to the interests
of his family, to ascertain whether he was living at
that period. From the changes which the body had
sustained, it was presumed that he had drowned
himself the day he left home; and to corroborate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>this presumption, the evidence of <i>Dr.</i>, now <i>Sir George,
Gibbs</i>, of Bath, was required, as he had lately been
engaged in experiments<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> upon this subject. He
stated on the trial, that he had procured a small
quantity of this fatty substance by immersing the
muscular parts of animals in water for a month, but
that it required five or six weeks to produce it in any
quantity. Upon this evidence the jury were of opinion
that the deceased was <em>not alive</em> at the time the
commission was taken out, and the bankruptcy was
accordingly superseded.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether any, and what marks, punctures, contusions,
echymoses, dislocations, or other injuries, are
to be observed about the face, neck, chest, or any other
parts of the body; and how far their appearance and
character demonstrate the nature of the operation, or
instrument by which they were inflicted?</i>—Upon the
discovery of a dead body, it becomes one of the first
objects to ascertain the nature, extent, and direction
of any wounds, or marks of violence, that may be
observed. Whether they be merely superficial, or
extend beyond the local injury and penetrate the cavities,
will be a matter of subsequent investigation
by dissection. The examination of deep wounds, in
the first instance, is comparatively unimportant, for
they are not liable to obliteration by incipient putrefaction;
whereas marks and bruises, unless they be
carefully inspected before the body undergoes this
change, will not be easily distinguished from spontaneous
discolouration. This precaution is highly important
in those cases in which we suspect the person
to have been strangled; when we shall generally discover
a circular mark about the neck produced by extravasated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>blood, or, if the act has been committed
by the hand, irregular patches corresponding in some
places with the fingers and nails of the assailant;
traces of violence will be frequently also discoverable
on the chest which will answer to the impression of
the knees. Upon examining the body of <i>Sir John
Dinely Goodere</i>, who was murdered on board the
<i>Ruby</i> ship of war in 1741, the surgeon’s mate stated
that he found the marks of nails and fingers on his
neck; this testimony was satisfactorily fortified by
another witness, who declared that on looking into
the cabin, he had seen a hand on the neck of the deceased.
An accomplice also confessed that after having
strangled him with their hands, they drew a rope
tight about his neck.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> A very satisfactory instance
of the same kind occurred to the author of the present
work, during his residence in the county of Cornwall;
and he feels no inconsiderable satisfaction in
reflecting upon the train of circumstances, through
which he was enabled, by his evidence at the assizes
of the county for 1814, to secure the conviction of
the murderer. The evidence was wholly circumstantial,
and the relation of it is well calculated to illustrate
the great importance of the particular line of
investigation, which it is the object of the present
chapter to elucidate. For these reasons he is induced
to compile from his notes the following brief sketch
of the case. A Cornish peasant, engaged in attending
upon the light-house on the western coast, was
found dead in a field near the public road leading
from Penzance to the “Land’s end,” on Sunday,
December the 12th, 1813; he was lying in a dry
ditch, with his stick at a little distance from him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>one of his shoes was down at the heel, and both
were smeared with mud; his pockets were empty.
The body was taken to a public house in the village,
and the coroner having received notice of the occurrence,
an inquisition was taken, and the verdict of
wilful murder returned against some person or persons
unknown. The body was afterwards buried,
but a rumour having arisen that the anatomical inspection
had not been sufficiently minute and satisfactory,
it was, by an order of the magistrates, disinterred;
and the author was desired to assist in the further
investigation of the subject. Upon examining the body,
which had not yet advanced so far in putrefaction as
to obliterate the traces of violence, or to confuse the
appearances they presented, patches, arising from
extravasated blood, were seen in different parts of
the throat, and distinct abrasions corresponding with
the nails were visible; the face presented the physiognomy
of a strangled man. On the chest, bruises,
evidently occasioned by the pressure of the assailant’s
knees, were also noticed. Upon dissection the brain
was found excessively turgid with blood. The rest
of the organs appeared in a perfectly healthy, and
natural condition. It is worthy of remark that the
field in which the deceased was found contained several
shafts of abandoned mines; upon visiting the
spot the author observed tracks in the grass, as if it
had been scraped, proceeding in a direction from the
hedge next the public road to that in the opposite
part of the field, and under which the body was
found; near the former hedge also some fragments of
a glass bottle were discovered. The deceased, it appeared,
had been at Penzance for some medicine,
and it was proved that he had left that town, on his
return to the light-house, with a phial in his pocket.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>All these circumstances combined, placed the matter
beyond conjecture. He had evidently been strangled,
probably at the spot where the glass fragments were
found, which were undoubtedly the remains of his
phial, broken during the scuffle; besides, it would appear
that he had been dragged along the field from this
spot to the opposite hedge, for marks denoting such
an act were visible on the grass, and this received
farther confirmation from the condition in which the
shoes of the deceased were found. Who then committed
the murder? From the circumstances of its
having been perpetrated in a field containing several
old mines, without any attempt on the part of the villain
to avail himself of the advantage which these caverns
would have afforded for the concealment of the
dead body, the author was convinced that the perpetrator
of the deed would be found in some stranger to
the country, for such a one alone could be unacquainted
with the mines to which we allude. The suggestion
of this idea very naturally gave a direction to the line
of inquiry. Were any suspicious strangers in Penzance
or its neighbourhood? Had the deceased been
seen in the society of any person unacquainted with
the country? He had been seen, it was discovered,
playing at cards in a public house with some of the
privates of the artillery stationed in the Mount’s
Bay, amongst whom was a very powerful and athletic
Irishman, of the name of <i>Burns</i>, who had lately
landed, and immediately enlisted into the corps.
<i>Burns</i> was accordingly arrested on suspicion, when
the purse of the deceased containing thirty shillings
was found on his person. He was, moreover, unable
to shew where he was at the time the deceased left
Penzance, in the evening; and he was subsequently
recognised by two witnesses who had seen him accompanying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the deceased on the road towards the Land’s
End. It is only necessary to add that he was convicted
and hanged; and it is not the least satisfactory
part of this case to state, that on the evening previous
to his execution he confessed to the author, that all
the circumstances of the case occurred precisely as we
have stated, that he strangled his victim with a pocket
handkerchief, but that from the difficulty of completing
the act, he was compelled to press his knees upon
his chest. In the year 1763, a person of the name
of <i>Beddingfield</i> was found lying near his bed, with
his face on the floor, and with one hand round his
neck. It was argued that he had probably fallen out
of bed in a fit of apoplexy, and that the pressure of
his own hand had occasioned the marks that were visible
on his throat; and a verdict was returned in
conformity with such an opinion. Circumstances,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
however, arose which excited a strong suspicion
against the wife and a man-servant named <i>Ringe</i>, and
they were accordingly charged with the murder, tried
at Bury St. Edmonds, and condemned. Before execution
the man confessed that he had strangled the
deceased, having seized him while asleep by the
throat, with his left hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether the wounds observed in the body were necessarily
of a mortal nature, or sufficiently severe to
have caused immediate death?</i>—It will be generally
impossible to solve this <a id='pro'></a>problem without the aid of
dissection, for although such injuries may appear extensive,
we have already in the course of the present
inquiries shewn the fallacies to which such indications
are exposed, (<i>see our chapter on wounds, vol.</i> ii, <i>page</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>116) and the practitioner who ventures to give his
judgment on such an occasion, without adequate
data, will render himself contemptible in the eyes
of the profession, and dishonest in the opinion of the
public.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether they were inflicted during life?</i>—In discriminating
between a wound inflicted upon the living
body, and one which has been artfully occasioned
after death, for the purpose of embarrassing judicial
inquiry, it will be essential to observe, whether any
hemorrhage has taken place, externally, or internally,
and, moreover, to ascertain whether the blood
so effused had coagulated. An instructive illustration
of this point is furnished in the very extraordinary
trial<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> of <i>Green</i>, <i>Berry</i>, and <i>Hill</i> in the year 1678,
for the murder of <i>Sir Edmonsbury Godfrey</i>, a zealous
protestant magistrate, during the pretended popish
plots in the reign of Charles the second. It appeared
from the evidence of one <i>Praunce</i>, that <i>Sir Edmonsbury</i>
was strangled by a handkerchief in Somerset
house, on a Saturday night, and after remaining concealed
until the following Wednesday, he was carried
at midnight into the fields beyond Soho, where he was
thrown into a ditch, and his own sword thrust through
his body, in order to excite a belief that he had committed
suicide. Upon the trial, Messrs. <i>Skillard</i> and
<i>Cambridge</i>, surgeons, stated that the sword must
have been passed through the body after death, <em>as
there was no evacuation of blood</em>, which must have
happened had such a wound been inflicted during
life.<a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> With regard, however, the fact of hemorrhage
being received as a test of life, a few observations
may be necessary; it must be remembered that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>extensive wounds may be inflicted on the living body,
with but little or no effusion of blood, but such
wounds always belong to the class of <i>lacerations</i>, see
<i>vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 123. On the other hand, the knife of the
anatomist not unfrequently draws considerable blood
from the dead body, and wounds have been known to
bleed long after life has fled; a fact which, as we
have already observed, has been raised by superstition
into prophetic importance. The orifice of a vein
that may have been opened during life will sometimes
bleed afresh after death; this occurred to a very
considerable extent in the body of the Prince Royal
of Sweden, who had died of apoplexy. <i>John Lees</i>,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
the subject of the noted inquest at Oldham,
bled after he was laid in his coffin; but, under such
circumstances, the blood is <em>never</em> found in the state of
coagulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it be determined that such wounds have been inflicted
during life, it then becomes important to solve
the following questions.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether they resulted from an act of suicide or otherwise;
whether from accident or design?</i>—There are
certain acts of violence which we feel no hesitation in
declaring are not likely to be accomplished by the individual
himself; such are incisions, or gun-shot
wounds on the back of the body, and, perhaps, fractures
of the skull; with regard to wounds in the
throat, the death of the <i>Earl of Essex</i>, during his
imprisonment in the Tower, has given rise to much
speculation, and the reader will find an interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>digression upon the subject in the history of <i>Bishop
Burnet</i>. Some stress has, in a late case, been laid
upon the fact of the wound being even and regular,
which it was asserted would not have happened
had it been inflicted by the hand of an assassin—<i>because
any struggle would have made it irregular</i>. This
is really a refinement that we do not pretend to understand.
Is not convulsive action likely to disturb
even the cold and calculating admeasurements of the
suicide? instances have frequently occurred where
even the chin has been cut during the operation, as
in the case which lately occurred near the Serpentine
river in Hyde Park, and yet no grounds existed to
excite the least suspicion of murder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the individual has perished by fire arms,
the circumstance of his fingers being found discoloured
by the combustion of the powder in the pan
has been alluded to by authors as a proof of suicide,
and it certainly carries some weight with it, although
the crafty assassin might contrive to produce such an
appearance. The state of the linen of the deceased,
as indicating the effects of a struggle, may furnish
some evidence upon these occasions; and cases have
occurred where bloody marks have been discovered
on parts of the body, which, from their situation,
could not have been produced by the deceased. In
<i>Hargrave’s</i> State Trials<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> there is a very remarkable
instance of a woman who was found in bed with
her throat cut, and a knife sticking in the floor near
her; three of her relations were in an adjoining
room, through which it was necessary to pass to the
apartment of the deceased; the neighbours were
alarmed, and the body was viewed; these relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>declared she must have destroyed herself; but, from
a particular circumstance, they were suspected, and
found guilty of the murder; for on the <em>left</em> hand, was
observed the bloody mark of a <em>left</em> hand, which of
course could not be that of the deceased. How often
has the left hand<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> of the murderer betrayed his
deeds of blood!</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether the cloaths of the deceased betray any
odour of spirit, tobacco, sourness, or putridity?</i>—In
every case of mysterious death it is an important object
to ascertain whether the deceased had been in a
state of intoxication; of which the odour of the
clothes may in some cases furnish a presumptive
proof. It will be seen by consulting our chapter on
“Death by exposure to Cold,” that the life of an individual
may, under certain circumstances of intoxication,
be extinguished by a very slight degree of
cold; <i>see vol.</i> ii, <i>page</i> 60.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether any articles have been broken or injured in
the pockets?</i>—The case of the Cornish murder related
at page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a> affords an example of the value of this
inquiry; but in appreciating the indications which it
may furnish, we must view the circumstance in relation
to the other features of the case, when it may
acquire an importance which the fact did not individually
assume; or it may lose by such a comparison
the little value which it appeared to possess.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether there is reason to believe that the deceased
had been robbed?</i>—We are to derive from this question
a probable argument in support of the fact of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>suicide, for in such a case it is not reasonable to expect
any evidence of robbery. In the unfortunate
case of suicide lately committed in Hyde Park, a base
sixpence was found in the pocket of the deceased;
had he been plundered, the robber would not have
left the base coin, which in the dark and hurry he
could not have distinguished. In the instance of a
travelling empiric, of the name of <i>Evans</i>, or <i>Evando</i>,
as he called himself, for the sake of euphony, who
was found dead in a ditch in Cornwall, the exact
sum was discovered in his pocket, which he had taken
in change at the last public house. Any memorandum
found on the person of the deceased, in his own hand-writing
intended to convey directions, or his last
wishes, to his friends, is a strong presumptive proof
that he fell by his own hand. The remains of any
poison found about him is one of those facts that
is equally favourable to the suspicion of murder as
of suicide. We must be allowed to observe that upon
the occasion of an unknown person being found
dead, some responsible individual should examine the
contents of his pockets, and having, if possible, acquired
every information as to his name and residence,
he should carefully enclose every article so found in a
paper, and place his seal upon the packet, and his
signature, and the date of the event, upon the cover.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>If the deceased be a female, whether there be any
marks or bruises that would indicate the commission of
a rape?</i>—The importance of this inquiry need not be
argued, nor is it necessary in this place to point out
the indications which may confirm our suspicions upon
this subject. We must refer the reader to our <a id='cha'></a>chapter
on rape, <i>vol.</i> I, <i>p.</i> 416. The interesting trial of
Abraham Thornton, for the murder of <i>Mary Ashford</i>,
abounds with curious evidence upon this point.</p>

  <h4 class='c014'>2. <i>Circumstances to be learnt by an examination of surrounding and collateral objects.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The information which may be occasionally derived
from the state of the objects surrounding the body,
will be best illustrated by the numerous cases in
which they have furnished the principal means of
discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether the spot in question be of a description to
explain the cause of the deceased having been found
there; or how far its retired situation excites the suspicion
that the body has been conveyed thither for concealment,
or some other purpose?</i>—Having examined
all the circumstances which attach to the
<em>person</em> of the individual, we should direct our attention
to the spot in which the body is found.
The Cornish case which is related at <i>page</i> <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>, offers
an admirable illustration of the utility of such observations.
The nature of the place may perhaps suggest
the probability of the person having fallen down
from some height, in which case any appearance of
wounds must be examined with reference to such a
suspicion. We may also in the progress of such an
inquiry be led to conclude that the spot may have
been infested with some unwholesome vapour, destructive
of life; the various circumstances which
may contribute to the generation of noxious air have
been fully examined under the head of <i>Suffocation</i>,
<i>vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 48, and were we to discover a dead body in
the vicinity of a lime-kiln, or in an unventilated
apartment, where charcoal<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> had been burning, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in a cellar where carbonic acid might probably have
accumulated, we should derive an important clue for
the investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether any indications of a struggle having happened
on the spot are visible on the ground, or herbage
near the deceased; and whether any footsteps can be
traced near the body?</i>—The Cornish case presents
itself to us again in illustration of this question.
There are also several cases where impressions upon
the snow have led to the detection of the guilty party.
In the case of <i>Wm. Spiggot</i>, <i>Wm. Morris</i>, <i>David
Morgan</i>, <i>Walter Evans</i>, <i>Charles Morgan</i>, and <i>David
Llewellin</i>, for the murder of <i>Wm. Powell, Esq.</i>
at Glenareth, in Caermarthenshire, March 30, 1770,
footsteps were traced from <i>Powell’s</i> house (a deep
snow having just fallen) to that of <i>Charles Morgan</i>,
who was in consequence apprehended, and did not
long deny the fact. Some very interesting evidence
was delivered upon the subject of footsteps, on the
celebrated trial of <i>Abraham Thornton</i>, for the murder
of <i>Mary Ashford</i>, at the Warwick assizes of 1817.
<i>William Lovell</i>, a workman at Penn’s Mills, and several
other witnesses, spoke as to the presence and
direction of the footsteps of a man and a woman,
which approached each other at one spot; their appearance
shewed that the persons had been running,
and dodging each other, “as well from the stride, as
the sinking in of the ground, and the little scrape at
the toe of the woman’s shoe.” The footsteps were
afterwards compared with the shoes of <i>Thornton</i>, and
found to coincide; the shoes, moreover, had a particular
nail, called a <em>sparrow bill</em>, the impression of
which was also perceptible. The same comparison
was made with the shoes of the unfortunate <i>Mary
Ashford</i>, and with a result which appeared to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>equally satisfactory and conclusive. Instances have
also occurred in which the presumption of guilt
against certain persons has arisen from the absence
of such marks; this happened in the murder of <i>Mr.
Jeffries</i>, by <i>Elizabeth Jeffries</i>, his niece, and <i>John
Swan</i>, his servant, at Walthamstow, in July 1751;
in which case the perpetrators of the deed were suspected
to have been domestics, from the single circumstance
of the dew on the grass surrounding the
house not having been disturbed on the morning of
the murder, which must have happened, had any
persons left the premises.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Has there been any thunder storm?</i>—For an account
of the appearances in the body of a person, who has
been thus suddenly deprived of life, we must refer
the reader to our chapter on “Death by Lightning,”
vol. ii, p. 63. It will, at the same time, be right to
consider, whether the death of the person in question
can have arisen from an exposure to the rays of the
sun, which has occasionally happened in the harvest
field—“And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe
and kindred, who died in the barley harvest. For
as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in
the field, the heat came upon his head, and he fell
on his bed, and died in the city of Bethulia.” <i>Judith</i>,
<i>chap.</i> viii, <i>v.</i> 2, 3. <i>Sauvage</i> relates the case of several
young persons, who suffered an asphyxia from sleeping
in an open field, exposed to the rays of the sun;
and it may deserve notice in this place, that in such
cases, hemorrhage from the nose is not an uncommon
occurrence; the appearance of blood will thus
receive an explanation which might otherwise excite
unjust suspicions of violence.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whether any, and what weapons are lying near the
body; and what is their position in relation to it?</i>—Much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>light may be thrown upon the inquiry by an
attentive examination of the weapons found near the
deceased; and some interesting cases are recorded,
wherein this circumstance alone led to their developement.
In the year 1764, a citizen of Liege
was found shot, and his own pistol was discovered
lying near him; from which circumstance,
together with that of no person having been seen
to enter or leave the house of the deceased, it
was concluded that he had destroyed himself;
but on examining the ball, by which he had been
killed, it was found to be too large ever to have entered
that pistol; in consequence of which, suspicion
fell upon the real murderers. The wadding of the
pistol has also in several instances offered the means
of affixing the accusation on the guilty. The Lord
Chancellor, in a debate in the House of Lords, in
November 1820, quoted a very curious case in which
the wadding of the pistol was found to correspond
with a torn letter in the possession of the murderer.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>If the body is found in the water, are there any and
what reasons for supposing that it was killed by other
means, and subsequently thrown into the water?</i>—This
question has upon several occasions been discussed
with great eagerness; see <i>the Reports of the Edinburgh
Colleges in the case of Sir James Standfield</i>, in
our <i>Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_a_255'>225</a>; and also <i>Extracts from the
medical evidence in the case of Spencer Cowper, Esq.
for the murder of Sarah Stout</i>, <i>ibid.</i> <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_a_230'>230</a>. We have
already, under the consideration of the phenomena
of drowning, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>, endeavoured to appreciate the
true value of the several indications which have been
received as physiological evidence upon this subject,
such as the presence of water<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> in the stomach and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>lungs, the buoyancy of the body, &amp;c. We have
therefore only to observe in this place, that upon
such occasions there will generally exist collateral
circumstances to fortify our judgment; where, for
instance, mud, or sand, are found under the nails, or
any grass or weeds are discovered in the grasp of the
deceased, the inference will be strong that the person
died under water; on the contrary, if we discover
mortal wounds, or any marks of violence inflicted
upon the body, by weapons, we may very justly suspect
that the deceased was murdered, and subsequently
thrown into the water. But in conducting
this enquiry we must be aware of the fallacies to
which it is exposed; a person may in the act of
drowning accidentally receive bruises and lacerations,
or he may have been driven against rocks and stakes
by the force of the current. The following case, related
by <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>, offers a very good illustration
of this point. “A few years ago, a man who
had leaped from each of the three bridges into the
Thames with impunity, undertook to repeat the exploit
for a wager. Having jumped from London
bridge he sunk and was drowned. When the body
was found, it appeared that both his arms were dislocated,
in consequence of having descended with
them in the horizontal, instead of the perpendicular
position.” If we arrive at the conclusion that the
body was drowned, we have next to inquire whether
the event was accidental or malicious? and whether
the act was perpetrated by the deceased or others?
The solution of these problems is to be generally
effected by the examination of what may be called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>external circumstances of the case; the locality of
the water may be such as to account for the deceased
having accidentally fallen into it, or its situation may
at once preclude the possibility of such an event.
The suspicion of the person having been violently
thrown into the water by the hands of the assassin,
will be fortified by the discovery of footsteps on the
brink, and by the indications of resistance on the
part of the deceased, as manifested by the appearance
of bruises on the arms and other members of the
body. In the case of <i>Mr. Taylor</i> who was murdered
at Hornsey, in December, 1818, marks of footsteps,
deep in the ground, were discovered near the new
river; and on taking out the body, the hands were
found clenched, and contained grass, which he had
torn from the bank. If the person be found in the
water tied hand and foot, there is a strong presumption
that he was forcibly placed in such a situation;
and yet there are two instances on record which afford
very extraordinary exceptions to the truth of such a
conclusion. The one occurred in the end of June,
1816, in the case of a gauging-instrument maker,
who had been missing from home for several days.
His body was discovered floating down the Thames;
and on being taken out, his wrists were found tied
together, and made fast to his knees, which were in
like manner secured to each other. He had been in
a state of mental derangement for two years. The
cord with which he had tied himself was recognised
as one that had hung from the ceiling over his bed,
by which he used to raise himself up, having been
confined to his bed for several weeks; he was a good
swimmer, and it was presumed he had taken the precaution
to prevent himself from swimming. The
verdict was “<em>found drowned</em>.” The other instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>occurred two years afterwards. A man, aged 28,
with a wife and children, was reduced to great distress.
On a certain day he took an affectionate leave
of his family, declaring he would not return until he
had obtained some employment, by which he should
be able to procure them bread. The following day
his body was taken out of the new river, with his
hands and legs tied. A card with his address was
found in his pocket; and also three-pence; when he
left home he had five-pence, and it was supposed that
he had purchased the cord with the deficient sum.
The verdict in this case was “<em>insanity</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>If the deceased be found hanging by the neck, whether
he was suspended during life, or hung up after death?
Whether it was an act of suicide or murder?</i>—In cases
where the deceased has been hanged alive, we shall
find the trace of the rope in the neck very distinctly
marked by a deep discolouration; whereas, the effect
occasioned by such a ligature upon the dead body,
will be far less striking. We have also to inquire
whether the deceased has any wounds, or whether,
upon dissection, the usual appearances are found
which generally occur in hanged persons. But,
should any marks of external violence present themselves
upon such an occasion, we must judge of them
with caution. They may perhaps be purely accidental.
<i>Dr. Male</i> supposes a case in which the person,
with the view of speedily destroying life, may have
thrown himself off with violence, broken the rope,
and wounded himself by falling upon articles of furniture,
and yet had sufficient fortitude again to suspend
himself. “An apprentice boy, in my neighbourhood,”
says this author, “working alone in an
attic, tied one end of a rope loosely round his neck
whilst his master was from home, probably without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>any intention of destroying himself, and twisted the
other round the projecting part of the top of a door,
the planks of which were irregular and somewhat divided;
a small stool, on which he stood, slipped
from under him, when he fell forwards, striking his
temple against the corner of a box which cut him to
the bone; he lay along the floor, his head and
shoulders only elevated a few inches above it; the
cord not being tied, had run nearly its whole length,
and then caught between the planks of the door; in
this state he perished. The wound was magnified by
popular rumour into many, and vengeance was denounced
against the innocent master, who was accused
of having first killed, and afterwards suspended
the boy. On examining the boy the mark of the cord
was found to extend from ear to ear; the vessels of
the brain were turgid, the thyroid cartilage broken;
the nails blue, and the hands firmly closed. From
this and other important circumstantial evidence, the
coroner’s jury were convinced that the charge was
unfounded.” <i>Dr. Smith</i> remarks that, except in the
instance of children, or extremely feeble persons, it
is very difficult to hang an individual by force, unless
the situation be remote, and no interruption
likely to take place; or the assailants be numerous
and powerful enough, (as in the celebrated case of
<i>Porteus</i>) to set all interference at defiance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Persons have been accidentally hanged, as in the
case above cited from the work of <i>Dr. Male</i>, and instances
are recorded where the operation has been
resorted to as a mode of exciting passion. In all
such cases of doubt and difficulty, each particular
circumstance, however minute, must be noticed—the
nature of the ligature—the manner in which it is
fixed—the state of surrounding objects, are often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>capable of throwing light upon the transaction. In
the case of <i>George Hebner</i>, a tailor, who was found
hanging to the top of a bedstead, in a garret of a
house of ill-fame in Dean Street, East Smithfield,
kept by a widow of the name of <i>Hughes</i>, the manner
in which the hands of the deceased were tied behind
his back, and his handkerchief was drawn over his
face, proved most decidedly that he had not strangled
himself. Upon examining the rope round his
neck, it was found to have been fastened by what is
termed a sailor’s knot; in consequence of which circumstance
a sailor named <i>Richard Ludman</i>, together
with the aforesaid <i>Eleanor Hughes</i>, were indicted
for the murder, found guilty, and executed.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>If the deceased be found in an apartment, whether it
be in a house of ill-fame?</i>—Although the act of sudden
death in a brothel very naturally excites the suspicion
that some act of violence may have been committed,
yet this feeling should not be carried too
far; we must remember that the individual has been
thus exposed, in an increased degree, to the occurrence
of several of those natural accidents by which
life is so suddenly extinguished; apoplexy, hæmopthysis,
and syncope have assailed those who might
have been predisposed to such diseases, at the moment
of sexual indulgence. In persons advanced in
life the trunks of the internal, carotid, and basilary
arteries are frequently diseased, and are therefore
very liable to rupture whenever the blood is accumulated
in any unusual quantity, or the circulation is
preternaturally accelerated.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h4 class='c014'>3. <i>Circumstances to be learnt by the Interrogation of competent witnesses.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It is merely necessary to enumerate the facts which
it is our duty to elicit by such an inquiry, in order to
shew their importance and relations; we shall therefore
conclude this part of our subject without any
farther comments, and proceed to furnish such directions
as may enable the medical witness to complete
his investigation by the anatomical examination of
the body, without which, our preceding researches
can never be received as satisfactory and conclusive.
“<i>Inspectio ejusmodi cadaveris adeo necessaria est, ut
omissa ea, nihil certi de reo statui possit.</i>”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'>4. <i>Circumstances to be learnt by Anatomical Dissection.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>After the observations which we have already offered
upon the subject of wounds, it can be scarcely necessary
to urge the necessity of a speedy examination of
the more superficial lesions, which are likely to be
effaced, or changed in character by the progress of
decomposition; “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">putredo mutat formam cadaveris et
lesionem</span></i>.” The deeper wounds may at the same time
be inspected, but the greatest care should be taken
that they are not extended during the dissection,
for unless they be preserved, as far as it is possible,
in their natural condition, we shall not be able to
establish a satisfactory connection between the external
injury, and the internal lesions with which it
may be complicated. Having complied with these
injunctions, we are to proceed to lay open the cavities.
The order in which these operations are to be
performed is not of much moment; but let it be generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>understood that the discovery of what may appear
sufficient to account for death in one cavity,
ought never to prevent our proceeding to the investigation
of the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dissection of the brain and its membranes.</i>—The
body having been placed on its breast, and the chin
raised and supported by a block of wood, the anatomist
must proceed by making an incision over the top
of the head, from the root of one ear to that of the
other; and then by dissecting off the integuments, so
as to invert one flap over the face, and the other over
the occiput, he will be able to discover whether the
scalp has sustained any injury, as indicated by the
presence of abscesses, sinuses, contusions, and extravasations;
he will, at the same time, ascertain
whether any fissure or fracture exist, or any morbid
change has occurred in the bone, such as sponginess,
exostosis, caries, or exfoliation. In performing this
part of his duty, we trust he will not mistake, as
<i>Hippocrates</i><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> confesses he once did, a fracture for
a suture, and vice versa. It is not always easy, however,
to determine whether a fracture discovered in
the cranium, was produced during life. If it should
have occurred immediately before the death of the
person, there will be found coagulated blood upon
the bone and in the fissures; if the individual has
survived for some time, there will be marks of inflammation,
and perhaps the formation of pus in contact
with the skull; but if a fracture has been occasioned
in making the dissection, an accident which
may occur in the most careful hands, the blood in the
fracture will not be coagulated, nor will there be
any effusion around the portions. The skull-cap may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>be now removed; for which purpose the cranium is
to be sawed in a circular direction, about a finger’s
breadth above the superciliary ridges, and lateral sinuses;
the operation must be conducted with great
care, or we shall be in danger of wounding the <i>dura
mater</i>; the bone must be then divided by a few slight
strokes with the chissel and mallet. We shall always
find a strong adhesion between the inside of the cranium,
and the <i>dura mater</i>; partly, in consequence of
the small blood-vessels with which these surfaces are
connected, and partly, from the close application of
the fibrous structure of the membrane to the bone,
and which will vary with the age of the subject, and
the form of the skull; the handle of the scalpel carefully
introduced will afford the best instrument for
overcoming this resistance, and will not be liable to
lacerate the <i>dura mater</i>, or to injure the brain. In
effecting the separation, the <i>meningeal vessels</i> frequently
deluge the whole surface with blood, a circumstance
that deserves attention, in as much as their
plenitude marks the congestive state of the brain; it
shews also that the blood is in a liquid condition, a
fact to which some importance has been attached, as
it is supposed to occur more particularly in cases of
suffocation. The inner surface of the skull may be
inspected with the view of ascertaining whether it be
carious. The <i>dura mater</i>, thus brought into view, may
exhibit marks of inflammation; or coagulated
blood or pus may be discovered on its surface, especially
in cases where external violence has been inflicted;
and it is particularly worthy of notice that
such an extravasation, or injury, is not necessarily
under the fracture, or part of the cranium upon
which the violence that produced it, had been received;
on the contrary it often happens that disorganization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>occurs in the hemisphere opposite to that
upon which the blow was struck; a phenomenon to
which the term “<i>contre coup</i>” has been aptly applied.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The <i>dura mater</i> may now be removed and thrown
back, by dividing it all round the margin of the
skull, and separating its attachment to the <i>crista galli</i>
with a pair of scissars; before we part, however,
with this membrane, we should observe whether any
osseous deposits,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> or other morbid alterations are
visible in its texture; for such changes are not uncommon
in the <i>dura mater</i>, especially in the falx:
the <i>tunica arachnoidea</i> thus brought into view may present
various morbid appearances; it may be opaque,
or water may be found effused under it.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a>. The <i>pia
mater</i> often exhibits its veins turgid with blood,
which indicates that some impediment had existed to
the return of the circulation from the head to the
heart. It is very important to distinguish between
this appearance and that which is the result of the
inflammation of the membrane; in this latter case,
it should be remembered, that the small <i>arterial</i>
branches are the vessels gorged with blood;<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and
which are so multiplied as to form, by their numerous
anastomoses, a beautiful network. In true inflammation
also the membrane will be found thickened.
There is still another source of fallacy with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>which the anatomist may have to contend in his examination
of this organ, a state of vascular congestion,
arising after death, from the effect of gravitation. In
attending however to the position of the head, and to
the circumstances above mentioned, it will not be
difficult to establish a just diagnosis upon these occasions.
Before cutting into the brain, we should observe
whether the convolutions are furrowed as usual,
for when much fluid is contained in the ventricles, as
in hydrocephalus, the <i>sulci</i> are more or less obliterated.
Such a change, therefore, will offer a precaution
to the anatomist, to proceed slowly in his
dissection, so that the accumulated fluid may not
escape. Where a person has been suddenly killed,
while in a state of health, the ventricles will, on
examination, appear merely lubricated with a fluid;
but in cases where the patient has died after protracted
disease, more or less serum will be found in
these cavities. In our examination of the substance
of the brain, we ought to notice its consistence and
tenacity, for in many recorded cases, a <em>part</em> of the
medullary mass has been found so morbidly soft as to
have assumed nearly the consistence of custard; and
it has been said to have occurred in cases of fatuity;
it seems, however, more correct to consider it as the
effects of inflammation: the phenomenon must be
carefully distinguished from that natural deliquescence
which the <em>whole</em> of the brain undergoes after
death, when in an incipient stage of putrefaction.
In some instances, the texture of the brain has been
found tougher than is natural, and even to have been
dry and friable. (<i>See our observations upon the brain
in cases of mania</i>, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 327.) Scrophulous and
encysted tumours, hydatids, abscesses, and extravasated
blood, may also occur, and its cavities may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>distended with fluid. The state of the larger blood-vessels
should be attentively inspected, for in persons
advanced in life there appears to be a strong disposition
to disease in the internal carotid and basilary
arteries. The great importance of minutely inspecting
every part of the brain cannot be too frequently,
or too <a id='for'></a>forcibly urged, in cases of forensic
inquiry. The instances already recorded (<i>page</i> <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>)
are sufficient to sanction this assertion; and to these,
we may add the following illustration which is to be
found in the article <i>Cas Rares</i> of the <i>Dictionnaire des
Sciences Medicales</i>, by <i>M. Fournier</i>, who was called
upon for his opinion in a case of alleged murder at Brussels.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
The deceased had quarrelled with another
man, some blows had been interchanged, and he had
died a fortnight afterwards, emaciated and completely
exhausted. Two of the lowest order of practitioners
in France, officiers de Santé, as they are called, inspected
the body, and pronounced that death had
taken place in consequence of the blows. <i>M. Fournier</i>
discovered an extensive suppuration in the brain,
with a very carious state of the inner surface of the
cranium, and learnt that the deceased had been afflicted
with head-aches for twenty years. He therefore declared
it to be his opinion, that the man had died of a
disease of long standing. In this opinion we concur,
but it is not equally clear that the crisis was not accelerated
by the violence which he had sustained.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We ought not to quit the examination of the head,
until we have examined the base of the cranium, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>order to determine whether any fracture exists in
that part; a curious case is related by <i>Mr. Charles
Bell</i>,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> of a person who died suddenly some weeks
after having received an injury of the head, when it
appeared, on dissection, that the base of the skull
had been fractured, and that the <i>foramen magnum</i>
having been thus roughened, a sudden turn of the
head had forced a spiculum of bone into the spinal
marrow. The brain has also received fatal injuries
from the introduction of pointed instruments through
the orbits; <i>Macklin</i>, the comedian, was tried for
killing a brother actor by the thrust of his cane.
<i>Thomas Dangerfield</i>, one of the celebrated and perjured
witnesses on the Popish plot, in the reign of
Charles II, was killed by <i>Mr. Robert Francis</i>, by
the blow of a cane, the end of which penetrated the
orbit.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The author also well remembers the case
of an old woman, who, in a fit of intoxication, fell
to the ground upon the stem of the tobacco-pipe
with which she was smoking, when it penetrated the
orbit, and occasioned immediate death; the cause of
her dissolution was never suspected until after dissection,
as no external wound was visible. In some
cases it may be considered expedient to extend our
anatomical researches into the spinal column, which
may be effected by sawing off the transverse processes.
The cervical vertebræ should always be
examined where dislocation of the neck can be suspected;
for in such cases death may be produced
without leaving any external vestige of the injury.
This has frequently occurred to coachmen and others,
who have been crushed while driving under low archways,
by which the nerves, necessary for the support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of the vital organs have been compressed or lacerated,
and death has in consequence ensued. If the
cervical vertebræ should be dislocated, a general paralysis
will follow, and life can no longer be maintained.
<i>M. Petit</i> relates the case of a boy suspended
by the head, who striving to disengage himself
dropped down dead; and <i>Dr. Monro</i> saw a case
where four of the cervical vertebræ were dislocated
by a fall, which ended fatally in a few hours.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dissection of the contents of the thorax.</i>—An incision
must be made through the integuments, in a
straight line from the <i>os hyoides</i> to the navel; we are
then to open into the cavity of the abdomen, for the
sake of affording the anatomist free space for his dissections
in the chest; and this is to be effected by incisions
from the navel to each spine of the ilium, so
that we shall have thus described by our dissection a
figure resembling the letter Y inverted, thus
<a href="images/inverted-y.png"><img src="images/inverted-y.png"
style="width:1em;" alt="Image of inverted Y" /></a>.
In
performing this part of our labour, it is essentially
necessary to avoid puncturing or injuring any of the
viscera; where such a blunder has been committed
the dissection has lost much of its value. The integuments
of the breast are then to be carefully dissected
so as to expose the cartilaginous articulations
of the ribs, which must be cut through on both sides;
the clavicles should also at the same time be separated
from the sternum, by dividing the loose cartilage
which unites them. The latter bone, together
with the cartilaginous portions of the ribs, must
be next turned upwards over the face, so that the
cavity of the thorax shall be brought into view.
In some cases it will be found expedient to make a
still more extensive exposure of this cavity; for
which purpose a broader flap must be turned up in
front, by extending our dissection of the parietes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the thorax farther towards the back; and, instead of
cutting through the cartilaginous extremities of the
ribs, dividing the bones themselves with a saw.
In bending back the sternum, or flap in front, we
must take care and divide the <i>mediastinum</i> with the
scalpel as near the bone as possible, in order to avoid
making any opening into the <i>pericardium</i>, which
would otherwise be very apt to happen. As soon as
an opening is effected into the thoracic cavity, the
lungs collapse, unless the adhesions formed between
them and the pleura should prevent it. Our first
object will be to observe whether any quantity of
fluid is present in the chest, and whether it be limpid,
as in dropsy; turbid and containing flakes of
coagulated lymph, as in cases preceded by much inflammatory
action; or purulent, as in empyema. Having
removed the liquid, should any be present, by
the application of a large sponge, we must proceed
to examine the lungs, as to their colour and general
appearance; and, by the introduction of a blow-pipe
into the trachea, we should by means of the mouth or
bellows inflate these organs, so as to ascertain the
degree of distention of which they are susceptible.
We may at the same time inspect their structure
more minutely by raising each lobe with the hand,
introduced into the cavity of the thorax for that purpose.
We are next to cut into their substance in
order to observe whether they are gorged with blood,
and inflamed; whether they are crepitous and light,
or dense like liver; and whether they contain any
tubercles; should these latter bodies be discovered,
we have to ascertain their magnitude, extent, and
maturity, and whether any of them have been developed
into <i>vomicæ</i>. The anatomist should be cautioned
not to mistake the deep colour, and compact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>texture which occur in the depending portions of the
lungs, from the mere accumulation of blood in consequence
of gravitation, for an inflamed state of the
organs; in which latter case a crowd of fine vessels
injected with blood of a florid colour furnish a diagnosis
that cannot be mistaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cases where a violent effort has preceded death,
violet-coloured spots containing venous blood may
be perceived on the surface of the lungs, and which
are true ecchymoses, occasioned by the rupture of
some small vessels. Such phenomena must be carefully
distinguished from the livid, black spots, which
have been observed in cases of narcotic poisoning,
and which are characterised by a more dense, and
less crepitating texture. In this stage of the dissection,
we may conveniently extend our examination
into the trachea, and bronchiæ, and observe whether
these tubes contain frothy mucus as in drowning;
coagulated blood, as in pulmonary hemorrhage;
pus, as in the event of the rupture of a vomica or
impostume; or ropy and tenacious mucus or lymph,
as in croup, tracheal inflammation, and bronchitis;
or chyme, as may occur in cases of intoxication, and
diseases of the brain, where vomiting has taken place
during a state of insensibility.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> We shall at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>same time be enabled to ascertain whether any mechanical
obstruction, from the presence of foreign
bodies, exists in the pulmonary passages, and which
might have occasioned death to the patient, as related
under our history of suffocation, vol. ii, p. 57.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The <i>pericardium</i> may now be laid open by a longitudinal
incision, and we should note the quantity of
fluid found in this cavity; in that of a healthy subject
there is generally as much as a tea-spoonful of
serum. It is important also that we should observe
the quality, as well as quantity, of this liquor.
Blood has occasionally been found in this situation,
when neither a rupture of the heart, or any of its
vessels could be discovered; in such cases <i>Dr. Baillie</i>
is of opinion that the blood has either passed
through the coats of the vessels upon the surface of
the heart, by transudation, or been poured out by
the relaxed extremities of the small vessels opening
upon the surface of that portion of <i>pericardium</i> which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>forms the immediate covering of the heart.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> The
general appearance of the heart, as to colour, flaccidity,
size, and external character, should be observed
before its cavities are opened; for the energy
of the heart may, in some degree, be inferred from
the tension of its fibres, and the red colour of its substance;
on the contrary, the opposite appearances
would indicate a very different condition of this vital
organ, as is well illustrated in the <i>asphyxia idiopathica</i>
of <i>Mr. Chevalier</i>.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> It is not very unusual to
find adhesions connecting the heart more or less
closely to the pericardium; and it is perhaps worthy
of remark that the length of these adhesions will furnish,
in some measure, an indication of the interval
that has elapsed, since the occurrence of the inflammation
by which they were produced; for they become
gradually elongated by the heart’s motion.
<i>Dr. Baillie</i> has noticed in his “Morbid Anatomy” an
appearance which the author has frequently met with
in his dissections,—a white opaque spot, as if from a
thickening of the pericardium; in some cases, it is
not broader than a sixpence, at other times, it equals
in size that of a crown piece; it is most commonly
situated on the surface of the right ventricle, and
consists of an adventitious membrane formed on a
portion of the pericardium, which covers the heart,
and may be easily dissected off, so as to leave that
membrane entire. The attention of the enquirer is directed
to the subject with a view to remind him, that
the appearance is one that ought not to be considered
as morbid in its origin, or dangerous in its effects.
In acute rheumatism a fatal translation of the disease
to the heart sometimes occurs, in which case, its surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>will be found encrusted with coaguable lymph.—The
condition of the blood-vessels forms the next
object of research; and they should be examined previous
to the removal of the heart, as to their calibre,
and thickness, and whether any inflammatory indications
are observable, or any aneurism; this latter
disease has often existed without exciting any suspicion
during life. In opening the body of George II,
the aorta was found callous at the lower border of its
curvature, and so dilated at its upper border, that it
was as thin as the finest paper, in which part the rupture
took place, and which was succeeded by a fatal
hemorrhage; and yet the king, before his death, had
not the slightest symptom that appeared to deserve
much attention. In every case of sudden death the
heart should be removed from the body for the purpose
of examination, and no anatomical evidence
should be received as conclusive, unless such an operation
has been duly performed. For this purpose,
the blood-vessels should be first secured by ligatures,
for it is very essential to prevent the effusion of
blood; and, having then separated it from its attachments,
we should proceed to examine the organ in the
following manner. Slit open, longitudinally, by
means of scissars, the right auricle, at its foreside,
then make an incision from the mouth of the pulmonary
artery to the point of the heart, guarding
against the accident of injuring the two sets of valves;
now cut open the whole length of the pulmonary artery,
except at its beginning, and at its valves, which
ought to be left entire; lastly, open the pulmonary
veins, and then the left auricle and ventricle, in a
similar manner with what was done to the corresponding
parts of the right side.</p>

<p class='c000'>We beg to direct the attentive consideration of the
anatomist to this important part of the inquiry; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>ought to notice the quantity of blood contained in the
cavities of this organ, as well as its colour, and state
of coagulation, especially in relation to the arterial
and venous sides of the heart; the indications which
such an examination may afford will be fully appreciated
by referring to our chapter upon “the
causes and phenomena of sudden death,” and that
upon “suffocation.” In examining the cavities of
the heart, especially the ventricles, it not unfrequently
happens, that a mass of coagulated lymph,
of a yellowish colour, and of considerable firmness,
is found to occupy them; this phenomenon, from the
manner in which its processes extend into the fasciculi
of muscular fibres of the heart, has acquired the
name of “<i>polypus of the heart</i>,” and was regarded by
the older anatomists as a very common and fatal disease.
It is necessary to observe that the phenomenon
is now better understood, and it is universally
admitted to be the result of slow coagulation after
death. The state of the valves of the heart should be
attentively inspected, for a disease in these parts may
have been the cause of the sudden death which we
are endeavouring to discover. The three <i>semi-lunar</i>
valves at the origin of the aorta, and the <i>mitral valves</i>,
are sometimes in a state of ossification; those placed
at the commencement of the pulmonary artery, and
the <i>tricuspid</i> are less disposed to take on morbid action
than the preceding ones that occupy the arterial
side; indeed, there are very few well authenticated
instances of such a change. Such a state of the valves
of the heart necessarily places the life of the individual
in extreme jeopardy, a rupture may be induced,
and thus prove instantly fatal, or the action of the
heart may be suddenly arrested, and a fatal syncope
be the result; and from the suddenness with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>death takes place in such cases, there is no doubt
that many persons so dying, have been erroneously
included in the list of apoplectic deaths. In certain
diseased states of the valves, the extremities of the
body become gangrenous, as if the heart were unable
to propel its blood to the extreme parts: the author
well remembers two females who were admitted into
the Westminster hospital, with a disease of this kind,
in which the gangrene gradually extended upwards,
and that, after death, the valves of the heart were
found ossified. The coronary arteries are occasionally
ossified, a circumstance which often accompanies a
diseased state of the valves of the heart, and that of
the aorta; a change which has been regarded as giving
rise to the disease, termed <i>angina pectoris</i>, but
which would seem to be symptomatic of any morbid
state of the heart. In some cases the heart itself has
been found ruptured; we have already offered some
observations upon this event, under the history of
syncope, p. 27. <i>Dr. Baillie</i> has seen only one case,
and in that, the blood escaped into the pericardium,
and the person instantly expired.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Examination of the abdomen.</i>—In proceeding to the
examination of this cavity, and its contents, the first
appearance to be noticed, is that of the <i>peritoneum</i>,
in which we have to observe whether any marks of inflammation
exist, as displayed by a crowd of very
small vessels, injected with florid blood, and a change
in the texture of the membrane, by which it appears
to be thickened, more pulpy, and less transparent.
The existence and character of any fluid in the abdominal
cavity should be noted, for its nature will be
found to be immediately connected with the nature
and extent of the disease by which it has been produced;
if the liver be schirrous, the fluid will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>tinged with bile, and of a yellowish colour; if extreme
debility accompany the disease, it will often
be of a chocolate colour, from the admixture of
blood; should no disease exist in any of the viscera,
it will resemble that of the serum of the blood. Previous
to the removal of the viscera for more minute
examination, it will be proper to observe their general
situation and appearance, and to notice particularly
whether the calibre of the visceral tube be natural,
distended, or contracted; in some instances its
diameter is sensibly diminished, as in cases of poisoning
by lead. It sometimes occurs that the intestines
are glued together with extravasated lymph; and, at
others, that the abdominal viscera are more or less
joined together by adhesions, which are the effects of
former inflammation; these adhesions become gradually
so elongated as to produce little or no inconvenience.
If upon opening the cavity of the abdomen
we should have reason to suspect the existence
of any perforations in the stomach or bowels, the
anatomist must proceed with great caution, so as not
to enlarge their diameters, or alter their appearance.
In the case of <i>Miss Burns</i>, the medical report lost
much of its value, from the want of due precaution
in this particular; <i>see our account of the dissection</i>, <i>vol.</i>
ii, <i>page</i> 178. Should the contents of the stomach or
intestines have escaped into the general cavity, we
should be careful in collecting such matter, with a
view to its future analysis. The size and appearance
of the stomach must be noted, and we should observe
whether any marks of inflammation, or gangrene, are
visible on its external surface; in tracing the intestinal
tube through its course, any appearance of inflammation,
or phlogosis, should be attentively examined; for
which purpose a ligature may be passed at some distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>above and below the patch, and the portions of
the intestine be then removed. In many cases it will
be essential to remove the stomach, as where poisoning
is suspected; for which purpose double ligatures,
about an inch asunder, must be placed above the
<i>cardia</i>, and similar ones in the <i>duodenum</i>; the division
may then be made by the scalpel in the space between
them. The stomach should be examined without
delay, for no one who has not been engaged in
such researches, can form an idea of the rapidity
with which this viscus loses its characteristic appearances
by exposure to air. The stomach is to be slit
open with a pair of scissars, care being taken that
none of its contents are lost. If the deceased had
been found in the water, the quantity of that fluid,
found in this viscus, should be noted; and under
such circumstances, the presence of any weed, mud,
or other extraneous matter, requires particular notice.
The quantity of alimentary matter will also
afford an object of remark, and it will be right to observe
whether, by odour or inflammability, the presence
of any spirit can be detected. Having then disposed
of the contents of the stomach, and referred
them to the chemist for examination, we proceed to
examine the viscus itself; in the first place, we
should be careful in ascertaining whether any white,
or shining particles adhere to its coats; if so, the substance
must be preserved for future analysis; the <i>cardia</i>
and whole interior of the stomach is to be carefully
inspected, and every indication of inflammation,
ulceration, gangrene, and schirrosity, is to be noted
in reference to its exact situation and appearance;
with a view to deduce an opinion as to the probability
of its being the effect of poisonous ingesta, or of recent,
or remote disease. The mucous membrane of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the stomach should be squeezed between the fingers,
and the nature of the matter, if any should ooze out,
must be noted, which on some occasions will furnish
a valuable diagnosis; where, for instance, the person
had died of <i>melæna</i>, a black matter, similar to that
vomited will exude, a phenomenon which is never
visible in cases of acrid or corrosive poisoning. We
have already entered so fully into the history of gastric
perforations, that it will be only necessary to allude
to them on this occasion; <i>see vol.</i> i, <i>page</i> 164.
The state of the villous coat should always be minutely
inspected, we should however be cautious in
pronouncing every red appearance as indicative of
inflammation; it may in some cases depend upon the
presence of colouring matter derived from the ingesta;
(<i>see the case related in vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 231.) Nor ought the
state of the œsophagus to be overlooked, which in
cases of poisoning will afford an important indication;
it should, therefore, be removed from the
body; had this dissection been performed in the case
of <i>Miss Burns</i>, the medical witnesses on that memorable
occasion, would have been spared, at least,
one great cause of censure. It is not impossible but
that the œsophagus may be ruptured in a violent paroxysm
of vomiting, and thus be the cause of death.
<i>Boerhaave</i> relates an interesting case of this kind,
which occurred to <i>Baron Van Wassener</i>, Admiral of
Holland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rupture of the stomach is an occurrence which
sometimes takes place from the action of vomiting,
during the progress of ulceration, when the membranes
of this viscus are nearly perforated. It also
occasionally happens from external violence. In the
<i>Medical Repository</i>,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> a case of ruptured stomach is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>related by <i>Mr. Brown</i>, in which the accident must
have been occasioned by the action of the diaphragm
and abdominal muscles, at the time of exertion, the
stomach of the individual having, from disease, been
less capable of sustaining any degree of violence.
The following are the particulars of the case; “A
coal-heaver, aged 50, whilst stooping in the act of
lifting some coals, placed his hand suddenly on the
pit of the stomach, and complained of severe pain in
that situation; this was immediately succeeded by
two deep sighs, when he dropped down and expired.
On dissection, the parts immediately round the opening
were in a higher state of vascularity than the rest,
and put on a decidedly torn appearance, which was
also observable in the peritoneal coat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In pursuing the track of the alimentary canal we
have to observe whether any marks of peritoneal inflammation
present themselves; and whether any
signs of inflammation in the muscular or mucous coats
are visible through the transparent parietes of the intestine;
and although no appearance of this kind can
be discovered on the external coat of the bowels, we
are not, on that account, to conclude that they have
been free from inflammation; we must persevere in
our dissection, and slit open the intestines in different
parts, especially at the entrance of the <i>ilium</i> into
the <i>colon</i>; the valve of the latter gut should also be
inspected; nor should the <i>rectum</i> escape our attention,
for its extremity is sometimes inflamed together
with the stomach, while the intermediate portions of
the canal are not in the least affected; this peculiarity
occurs in many cases of poisoning, as those,
for instance, in which colocynth or elaterium have
been exhibited. An empoisoned clyster may have
been administered; or, as in the case of <i>King Edward</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>II, a hot poker, or some other instrument thrust up
the rectum. We should also in this part of the dissection,
ascertain whether any <i>intus-susceptio</i> has
taken place, a derangement not very rare, and frequently
fatal; it consists in a portion of gut passing
for some length within another portion, and dragging
along with it a part of the mesentery; it may take
place in any part of the canal, but it more usually
occurs in the small intestines, especially where the
ilium terminates in the <i>colon</i>; in the examination of
infants an <i>intus-susceptio</i> is not unfrequently found,
which had been unattended with mischief, and in
which the natural peristaltic motion of the intestines
would have easily disentangled them; but, in other
cases, an unrelenting obstruction is established, inflammation
follows, and life is soon terminated, as
was exemplified in the case of the infant Princess
Elizabeth of Clarence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The liver may present several morbid phenomena,
which, in a dissection instituted for the purpose of
discovering the cause of death, ought not to be overlooked.
It may also be found ruptured, an occurrence
which may take place where little or no external
injury can be perceived, as from a sudden fall,
or from the application of strong pressure applied to
the upper part of the abdomen, such as might be occasioned
by the passage of a heavy carriage over the
body. <i>Morgagni</i> relates several instances of ruptured
liver, by mechanical causes, without any considerable
injury of the integuments. In the <cite>Medical
Transactions of the College of Physicians</cite>,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> a very
interesting case is communicated by <i>Dr. George
Pearson</i>, of a young man who fell with his <i>right hypogastrium</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and <i>epigastrium</i>, upon the edge of a
pail, which he held in his hand, as the sixth step of a
ladder, upon which he was standing, suddenly broke;
his death happened ten hours after the accident, and
upon dissection, the right lobe of the liver was discovered
divided, in an oblique direction, through its
whole substance, from its extremity on the right
side, to the border of the left lobe; the two portions
being only connected by the <i>vena cava</i>, and the trunks
of the <i>venæ cavæ hepaticæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author has been informed by <i>Dr. Harrison</i>
that, while at <i>Mantua</i>, he saw a man who had received
a kick on the right <i>hypochondrium</i> from a horse that
he was shoeing; he did not complain of much pain at
the time, but exhibited an anxious countenance, and
was attacked with <em>coffee-ground</em> vomiting. He died on
the following day, and upon opening the abdomen
the liver was found ruptured, and the peritoneum
inflamed.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The spleen may be brought into view for our examination
by drawing the stomach towards the right
side, when the one viscus will follow the other. This
organ, like the liver, may be ruptured by violence;
of which we have already cited an instance<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>pancreas</i> is to be seen by tearing through the
great omentum, between the large curve of the stomach,
and the arch of the colon. The anatomist will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>proceed to the examination of the remaining structures
in the abdomen with a facility that renders any
farther directions unnecessary; we have only to repeat
that in cases of forensic interest, the inspection
cannot be too minute. The appearance of the kidneys,
although not generally an object of dissection,
ought to be noticed, as it is frequently connected with
the exhibition of poisons; like the other solid viscera
too, the kidneys may be ruptured by external violence,
and several instances are recorded of sudden
death having been thus occasioned.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Examination of the uterus and its appendages.</i>—In
the case of a female the organs of generation should
always be inspected; very important conclusions
may be deduced from the discovery of an unimpregnated
uterus. In the case of <i>Miss Burns</i>, to which
we have so frequently alluded in the progress of our
work, this part of the dissection was so incomplete as
to occasion considerable dissatisfaction. The uterus
and its appendages having been carefully removed
from the body, we should proceed to expose the cavity
of the former by an incision, from near the <i>os
tincæ</i> to the <i>fundus</i>, and by a transverse section at
the <i>fundus</i>, between the inner ends of the <i>fallopian
tubes</i>. This organ is liable, amongst other diseases,
to inflammation, ulceration, schirrus, tubercles, polypus,
dropsy, and organised masses, or <i>moles</i>; upon
which we shall offer such observations as appear to
connect the dissection with questions of forensic interest.
In an adult and unimpregnated female its
length is about 2½ inches; its thickness, 1 inch; its
breadth at the fundus 1½ or 2 inches, and at the cervix
about 10 lines. Although it returns after parturition
to its original size, it never becomes again so small
as it was in the virgin. In women who have borne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>many children, the neck of the uterus is generally
thicker, and more rounded; its orifice, or <i>os tincæ</i>,
is always very gaping, and the lips more or less irregular,
presenting generally one or more grooves, or
chops, separated by what appear like tubercles. The
<i>os uteri</i> may, however, be as regular in its figure in
women who have borne children, as in others; and
on the contrary, it may present in the latter, those
irregularities which are more usual in the former;
hence the inferences drawn from the state of this part,
in cases where infanticide is suspected, or where parturition
is supposed to have been concealed, cannot
be received as being unexceptionable, although they
will add to the weight of evidence, and assist us, in
conjunction with other evidence, in attaining that
high degree of probability, which practically amounts
to certainty. The cavity of the <i>cervix uteri</i> undergoes
also a change in form and appearance, which it is
necessary to notice, although we are not disposed to
assign very great importance to its indications. In
women who have never borne children, the figure of
the cavity may be said to resemble that of two cones
joined bases to base, more capacious in the middle than
at the two extremities; but, from the time of conception,
that extremity of the canal, which opens
into the vagina, is dilated; and, after parturition has
once occurred, it is always found much wider than
before, when it represents a cone with the basis
towards the <i>vagina</i>, and the apex towards the <i>fundus
uteri</i>. By a schirrous enlargement, the uterus may
arrive at a very considerable size. <i>Dr. Baillie</i> has
seen it as large as the gravid uterus at the sixth
month; the cavity may also enlarge and contain a
<i>polypus</i>, which is a very common disease at middle
or advanced age; it has been defined “a diseased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>mass, which adheres to some part of the cavity of
the uterus, by a kind of neck, or narrower portion.”
An attempt was made on the trial of <i>Charles Angus</i>
to explain the appearance presented by the uterus of
<i>Miss Burns</i>, upon the supposition of an <i>hydatid</i> having
been recently ejected from it, (<i>see vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 254.)
Water has been known to have accumulated in very
considerable quantities in the cavity of the uterus,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
in some cases to the amount of fifty, sixty, or
even a hundred pints.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a woman die from hemorrhage, or from any
other cause in child-birth, the appearances that will
present themselves on dissection have been thus
clearly described by <i>Professor Burns</i>.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> “The
uterus is found like a large flattened pouch, from nine
to twelve inches long; the cavity contains coagula, or
a bloody fluid, and its surface is covered by the remains
of the decidua. Often the marks of the attachment
of the <i>placenta</i> are very visible. This part is of a dark
colour; so that the uterus is thought to be gangrenous
by those who are not aware of the circumstance.
The surface being cleaned, the sound substance of the
womb is seen; the vessels are extremely large and
numerous; the fallopian tubes, round ligaments, and
surface of the ovaria, are so vascular that they have
a purple colour. The spot where the ovum escaped
is more vascular than the rest of the ovarian surface.
This state of the uterine appendages continues until
the womb has returned to its unimpregnated state. A
week after delivery, the womb is as large as two fists;
at the end of a fortnight, it will be found about six
inches long, generally lying obliquely to one side;
the inner surface is still bloody, and covered partially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>with a pulpy substance like decidua. The muscularity
is distinct, and the orbicular direction of the
fibres round the orifice of the tubes very evident.
The substance is whitish. The intestines have not
yet assumed the same order as usual; but the distended
cæcum is often more prominent than the rest. It
is a month, at least, before the uterus returns to its
natural state, but the os uteri rarely, if ever, closes
to the same degree as in the virgin state.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The ovaria are susceptible of very considerable enlargement
by diseases, so as to occasion the appearance
of pregnancy, the most common of which is
dropsy; in some cases the whole substance is converted
into a capsule containing fluid, so large as to
occupy nearly the whole cavity of the abdomen.
There is one phenomenon, connected with the morbid
anatomy of these organs, that deserves particular
notice in this work, as being a subject in some degree
connected with judicial enquiry—the change
of these parts into a fatty substance containing hair
and teeth! these appearances have been often regarded
as imperfect ova, in consequence of impregnation,
but it should be generally known that they take place
without any intercourse between the sexes, and appear
to depend upon causes very remote from those
to which we allude.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> In our examination of the
ovaria, it is essential to remark whether any <i>corpus
luteum</i> be present; and upon this subject and the value
of its indications, it will be necessary to offer a
few remarks. The <i>corpora lutea</i> are oblong glandular
bodies, found in the ovaria of pregnant animals;
they have been regarded as the <i>calyces</i>, from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the impregnated ovum has dropped;<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> they are
largest and most conspicuous in the early state of
pregnancy, and remain for some time after delivery,
when they gradually fade and wither until they disappear.
The phenomenon has been eagerly seized
by the juridical physician as furnishing an indication
of pregnancy; and, to a certain degree, the test may
be admitted; but cases have occurred in which a <i>corpus
luteum</i> has been found, where impregnation could
not have occurred;<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> it is probable that upon certain
occasions extreme salacity may disengage an
ovum, and thus produce the <i>corpus luteum</i>, although
the former without sexual intercourse can never be
developed in the uterus; but this is an exception to
the general law of Nature, and the <i>corpus luteum</i>
may still be regarded as a presumptive proof of pregnancy.
<i>Mr. Stanley</i>, in a very excellent memoir,
published in the <cite>Medical Transactions of the College</cite>,
<i>vol.</i> vi, observes that “the <i>corpora lutea</i> in the ovaries
of virgins may, in general, be distinguished from
those which are the consequence of impregnation, by
their smaller size.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After all that has been said, our opinion in a case
of supposed impregnation must, in the earlier stages,
be formed from a review of all the circumstances appertaining
to the condition of the uterus, ovaria, and
fallopian tubes; and should these present such appearances
as they usually assume in pregnancy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the condition of the mammæ should at the same time
agree with them, the proof is strongly presumptive;
although it must fall short of the demonstration which
the actual inspection of the <i>ovum in utero</i> can alone
afford.</p>

<p class='c000'>The external parts of generation ought also to constitute
an object of inspection. We have already considered
the degree of evidence which they are capable
of affording upon the subject of virginity, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i>
203, 429. In examining the vagina, it will be necessary
to observe whether any shining or gritty particles
are discoverable, (<i>see vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 222.) It is also
possible that some hard body may have been introduced
into the genital organs, for a felonious purpose;
a trial for a crime of this nature took place at
Durham in the year 1781, when <i>Magaret Tinckler</i>
was indicted for the murder of <i>Janet Parkinson</i>, by
having inserted wooden skewers into the womb, for
the purpose of producing abortion; it appeared on
dissection that there were two holes, in a gangrenous
condition, which these extraneous bodies had occasioned,
and to which the deceased had fallen a victim.
<i>East’s P. C. tit. Murder.</i> Had these skewers been
introduced after death, the appearances would have
immediately denoted the fact, and could not be mistaken
for the effects of inflammation and gangrene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having concluded our dissection, it will be right
to preserve those parts, from whose condition or appearance
any legitimate deduction can be made. In
cases of poisoning, the stomach and intestines should
be kept, for we may require them in our subsequent
experiments. In the occurrence of eschars, perforations,
and gangrenous, or inflamed patches, the anatomist
should remove such appearances together with
a portion of the surrounding sound parts, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>should carefully preserve them in alcohol, or in salt
and water; and in cases where the state of the uterine
system is involved in the inquiry, the uterus and its
appendages, should be removed. In the case of <i>Miss
Burns</i>, the witnesses must have experienced a considerable
degree of satisfaction arising from a precaution
of this kind, for they were thus enabled to obtain
a confirmation of their opinion from the most eminent
midwives in London.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this service has been duly performed, the
body must of course be committed to the grave; but
should it not have been satisfactorily identified, the
head ought to be preserved in spirits, in as natural
a state as possible, that it may be recognised by the
friends of the deceased. A curious instance stands
on record, where this precaution led to the detection
of the murderers. <i>Catherine Hayes</i>, and two accomplices,
<i>Billings</i> and <i>Wood</i>, murdered the husband of
the former, cut off his head, and threw it into a dock
near the Horseferry, Westminster. The head was in
a few days found, and exposed on a pole in St.
Margaret’s Church-yard, and afterwards preserved
in spirits, by which means the face of the deceased
was identified, and the perpetrators of the crime
discovered, for which they were executed at Tyburn
in the year 1726.</p>

<h5 class='c014'>EXAMINATION OF THE SKELETON.</h5>

<p class='c012'>It will appear in the course of the present inquiry,
that the anatomist may be called upon to examine a
part, or the whole skeleton of a person supposed
to have been murdered; and his evidence upon such
occasions will be of the greatest importance. Convinced
of this fact, we are induced to offer the following
observations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The stature of the human skeleton varies very
considerably in different individuals; in the Museum
of the College of Surgeons there is a male skeleton,
the height of which is eight feet two inches; while
we are informed by <i>Mr. Wilson</i>,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> that he has seen a
perfectly well formed skeleton of an adult person
which measured only thirty-five inches; and a dwarf
was lately exhibited in London of a still less stature;
but in this latter case, the head was disproportionably
large. There may have been some individuals
a few inches taller, and others a few inches shorter
than these, but we have no authentic records of the
human stature exceeding nine, or at most, ten feet.
The size and dimensions of the human figure, notwithstanding
the fables of antiquity,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> appear to have
been much the same in all ages of the world. The
Egyptian mummies of three thousand years standing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>exhibit no difference in stature from the men of our
own days; and we read that the Emperor Augustus
was considered by the Romans as a person of middle
stature, and his height is recorded as that of five
feet, nine inches, of our measure.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our general view of the human skeleton, two
important problems present themselves for solution—the
<em>Age</em>, and <em>Sex</em>, of the individual to whom it belonged.
The skeleton of the fœtus, with which we
shall commence our observations, is capable of furnishing
more satisfactory data upon the subject of
age than any examination of its softer textures, which
are necessarily less evident and regular in their progress
of developement. <i>M. Beclard</i> has deduced
from his examination of above fifty fœtuses, the following
calculations, which it may be important to
record. After two months have elapsed from the
period of conception, the skeleton is about 4 inches
and 3 lines in length, that of the spine being 2 inches.
At three months, the former is 6 inches, and the
proportion of the spine as 2⅔ to 6. At four months
and a half, it is 9 inches, and the spine 4. At six
months it is 12 inches, the spine being 5. At seven
months and a half, it is 15 inches, the spine 6⅓. At
nine months, or at the period of birth, it is ordinarily
from 16 to 20 inches in length; or, at a medium, 18
inches, and the spine is in the proportion of 7¾
to 18.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ossification does not take place with equal rapidity
in every bone; the ribs and clavicles are completely
converted into bone long before birth, while the
bones of the <i>carpus</i>, <i>tarsus</i>, and more particularly
the <i>patella</i>, are not completed until some years afterwards;
certain parts of bones are not formed until
after birth, as the <i>mastoid processes</i>, and the projections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>of the <i>frontal sinus</i>; nor are the <i>epiphyses</i>
consolidated with the body of the bones, so as to constitute
<i>apophyses</i>, until many years. With regard
to the general developement of the skeleton after
birth, it may be observed, that the proportion of cartilage
is in an inverse ratio to the age; reckoning
from the twentieth year backwards, the younger the
subject the larger is its head, compared with the
trunk and limbs; the smaller the bones of the face,
but the larger the fontanelles; the flatter is the lower
part of the face; the larger the chest, in relation to
the pelvis; the shorter the limbs; the larger the
clavicles; the smoother and flatter the broad bones,
but the rounder those that are cylindrical. (<i>See
Albert Durer on the proportions of the bones</i>, <i>Lib.</i> 1.)
The chemical composition of the bones, in relation
to their <em>phosphate of lime</em>, and <em>gelatine</em>, varies also
very materially at different ages. It may be stated
that the quantity of the former substance deposited
in the texture of bones, is in the direct ratio of the
age; the bones of the fœtus are at first entirely gelatinous;
at the time of birth, and during the first
years of life the organic part superabounds; in youth
the quantity of each constituent is nearly equal; in
adults the calcareous earth forms almost two-thirds
of their substance; and finally, by gradual accumulation
in old age, its excess obliterates the organized
parts; so that the skeleton of the aged person may be
distinctly recognised; besides which, the sutures of
the skull are generally lost, and the absorption of
the alveolar processes again imparts to the face the
physiognomy of the infant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The male and female skeleton may be said to differ,
not only in the whole combination, or in the general
impression, from a comparative survey, but also in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the form and properties of the individual parts. The
bones of the female are generally smaller, more
delicate, and the muscular impressions, and asperities
are less distinctly marked on them. The articulations
are smaller, and the shaft or body of each
cylindrical bone is more slender in comparison with
the articular ends; the frontal sinuses are smaller,
and the superciliary arches less prominent; all the
bones of the face are more slender; the figure of the
alveolar circle is more elliptical in both jaws;
whereas in the male it is more circular. The differences,
however, are in many cases very equivocal,
since they may occur in the male as well as in the
female skeleton; in the former, where the individual
has had a feeble constitution, and never used active
exercise; while in the latter, hard labour will frequently
confer upon her bony structure the masculine
contour which we have described as generally belonging
to the male skeleton. The only decisive
marks, therefore, by which a female skeleton can at
once be distinguished, are to be found in the structure
of the pelvis, and arise from the obvious cause of
the female possessing a proper frame to become a
mother. The pelvis of a female, at and below the
<i>linea innominata</i>, formed by the lower part of the
inside of the <i>ileum</i>, and ridge of the <i>pubes</i>, is much
more capacious, from side to side, than in the male.
The entrance or brim of the cavity is also more oval,
the greatest diameter being from side to side. In
the male it is more triangular, and the greatest
diameter at the brim is from the fore to the back
part; there is not much difference in the breadth of
a male and female pelvis, belonging to individuals
of nearly the same height, if measured from the anterior
part of the spine of the <i>ileum</i> to the corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>part of the opposite side; the difference in
breadth is chiefly confined to the basin-like part of
the cavity. The <i>symphysis pubis</i> is broader in the
female, and the angle underneath it is much more
obtuse, the space between the descending rami of
the pubes is consequently larger. The <i>sacrum</i> is
broader, less curved, and turned more backwards;
this also adds to the capacity of the cavity. The <i>os
coccygis</i> is more moveable, and much less bent forwards
so that it does not project so much into the pelvis.
The <i>tuberosities</i> of the <i>ischia</i> are farther distant from
each other, and from the <i>os coccygis</i>; and as these
three points are farther asunder, the notches between
them are consequently wider, and there is of course
a much greater space between the <i>os coccygis</i> and
<i>pubes</i>; and lastly the whole <i>pelvis</i> is less massy, but
more capacious and shallow in the female structure.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
There are, moreover, some striking peculiarities
to be discovered in the structure of the thorax,
which if not equally satisfactory with that
derived from a comparison of the <i>pelvis</i>, deserve
serious attention. The whole thorax is shorter in
the female, larger above as far as the fourth rib,
narrower below; more moveable, less conical; more
convex in front; more distant from the <i>pelvis</i>, the
interval between the last rib, and the <i>os innominatum</i>
being greater; less prominent anteriorly, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>when the trunk is supine, the <i>symphysis pubis</i> is the
highest point in the female, whereas in the male
subject, the thorax is the most elevated; the sternum
is also shorter in the female, ending at the plane of
the fourth rib, while it reaches to the plane of the
fifth in the male; the clavicles are likewise less
strongly curved, so that the <i>scapulæ</i> are thrown backwards;
the female <i>scapulæ</i> are, moreover, smaller,
slenderer, flatter, and have acuter angles than those
of the male.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have been thus minute in our endeavour to
establish rules for discriminating between the male
and female skeleton, because it has been a question
of judicial inquiry. The supposed difficulty of ascertaining
the sex of a skeleton constituted a principal
feature in the celebrated defence of <i>Eugene Aram</i>
for the murder of <i>Daniel Clarke</i>, and which, on account
of its extreme ingenuity, has been introduced
at length in our <i>Appendix</i>, p. <a href='#Page_a_311'>311</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In examining detached and isolated portions of
the skeleton, we must take care not to mistake natural
fissures and <i>foramina</i> for the effects of violence;
we have already observed that the <i>sagittal suture</i> has
been pronounced to be a fracture. But the most
extraordinary illustration of such an error that can
be adduced, is that presented to us in the history of
a case that occurred at Exeter, and which the author
of this work is enabled to present in an authentic
form through the kind assistance of his friend, <i>Wm.
Tucker, Esq. of Coryton, Devonshire</i>, a gentleman,
who has been too long known, and too universally
respected, as an active and upright magistrate, to
render any panegyric necessary on the present occasion.</p>

  <h6 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Case of Thomas Bowerman.</span></h6>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Devonshire.</span>——<i>At the Devon Assizes in March, 1800,
a Bill was preferred before the Grand Jury against</i>
Thomas Bowerman, <i>for the Murder of</i> Mary
Gollop, <i>a Bastard Child of</i> Sarah <i>his Wife, by
another man, previous to her marriage, at the
parish of Uffculme, in the said County</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mary Gollop</i> lived with her mother, the wife of <i>Thomas
Bowerman</i>, in <i>Bowerman’s</i> house, at Uffculme, and had
been often noticed on account of the ill treatment she was
known to experience from <i>Thomas Bowerman</i>. About
Michaelmas, 1797, being then about fourteen years of age,
she was reported to have died suddenly in her father’s house,
and she was accordingly buried on the first day of October,
1797, in the church-yard of Uffculme.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January, 1800, <i>Thomas Bowerman</i> was committed to
the Devon Bridewell, at the suit of the overseers of the poor
of Uffculme, on a conviction for having ran away and left
his children chargeable to the parish of Uffculme. His wife
was at that time dead, and <i>Elizabeth</i>, one of his children,
about twelve years old, had been removed to the parish
workhouse, and was there maintained at the expense of the
parish. <i>Elizabeth Stark</i>, the mistress of the workhouse, in
a conversation with <i>Elizabeth Bowerman</i>, mentioned to her,
that on her father’s return from Bridewell, after the expiration
of his sentence, she would be sent to her father’s
house to be by him maintained and clothed. <i>Elizabeth
Bowerman</i> burst into tears, saying she could never again live
with her father if he did return, as she was afraid he would
murder her as he did her sister. She then stated that her
father killed her sister, <i>Mary Gollop</i>, by pushing an awl
into her head. She saw him do it, and he made her mother
and herself wipe up the blood, and said he would serve her
the same if ever she told of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span><i>Mrs. Stark</i> remonstrated with <i>Elizabeth Bowerman</i> on the
incredibility of her story; but in spite of all admonition,
she persisted in asserting the truth of her statements,
repeated without variance the particulars of the case, and
pointed out the part near the ear where the perforation had
been made. On the prevalence of this report, in the month
of February, 1800, it was judged expedient by the parishioners
to consult the Coroner, who ordered the disinterment
of the body of <i>Mary Gollop</i>, and held an inquest, by whom
the skull was inspected, on which was found a small hole of
the size of an awl on the side of the head near the ear, in
the place that <i>Elizabeth Bowerman</i> had pointed out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jury thereupon returned against <i>Thomas Bowerman</i>
a verdict of Wilful Murder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The circumstances of this case excited the attention of the
late <i>Mr. Sheldon</i>, then living in Exeter. He obtained access
to the skull, and on viewing it declared his opinion that the
hole in the skull, supposed to have been made by an awl,
was a natural perforation, and had not been effected by an awl
or any other instrument; and as proofs of his position, he
pointed out a small bed or channel leading from the hole,
which he said was made by the passage of a vein, and a sort
of enamel round the hole, which could not have been there
if made by force or art. In further illustration of this truth,
he produced a dozen or more human skulls having on them
similar perforations variously situated, and each hole having
a small channel, and the rim or edge of the hole smooth and
polished.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Sheldon</i> attended the Grand Jury at the said assizes
on the investigation of this charge: before whom it is presumed
he gave the same testimony. The Grand Jury returned
“No Bill” against <i>Thomas Bowerman</i> for the murder of
<i>Mary Gollop</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another question of forensic interest has arisen
upon this subject that requires some notice. Whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>there are not bones in the structures of inferior animals,
that so nearly approach those of the human
species in figure and appearance as to admit the
possibility of their being mistaken for them, by the
superficial anatomist? It must be admitted that there
does exist a similitude in the skeletons of different
animals, of which the common observer cannot derive
the least notion from the shape of the parts they
sustain, or from the general aspect of their external
form. <em>Bats</em>, for instance, appear to have wings, but
an attentive examination demonstrates that they are
real hands, the fingers of which are merely somewhat
lengthened; still, however, it is the bones of quadrupeds
that can alone be mistaken for those of man,
and of these the cylindrical ones are the most likely
to mislead us; for example, the <i>Humerus</i> varies
little in its form, except perhaps in the proportional
length of the bone, and the elevation of its spines:
the <i>Ruminantia</i>, in general, have the <i>great tuberosity</i>
very high, and the <i>linea aspera</i> very prominent. To
<i>Cuvier</i> we are much indebted for the marks of discrimination
by which we may determine to what
genus of animal the isolated parts of a skeleton belong;
and his researches have changed the opinion
regarding the character of many organic remains.
Most of the labourers in the Gypsum quarries about
Paris are firmly persuaded that the bones which they
contain are, in a great part, human remains; but,
after having seen and carefully examined many thousands
of them, <i>Cuvier</i> unequivocally declares that
not a single fragment has ever belonged to our
species. Another similar discovery has been made
by this illustrious anatomist, in the history of the
extraneous fossil bones from the island of Cerigo,
and deposited by <i>Spallanzani</i> at Pavia as human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>remains, but of which he affirms there is not one
that ever formed a part of the human skeleton; the
same <em>tact</em>, if we may so express this peculiar merit of
<i>Cuvier</i>, enabled him to decypher the “<i>Homo Diluvii
Testis</i>” of <i>Scheutzer</i>, and to restore it to its true
genus, the <i>Proteus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall close our remarks upon the fallacies by
which the bones of quadrupeds have been mistaken
for those of man, by the interesting account of the
remains which were found by <i>Belzoni</i> in a sarcophagus
in the second pyramid of Egypt, and for a detailed
relation of which we are indebted to <i>Captain
Fitzclarence</i>, in his overland route from India. These
bones were believed to be no other than the remains
of <i>King Cephrenes</i>, who, according to <i>Herodotus</i>, is
supposed to have built the pyramid, and to have
been buried in its cavern; unfortunately, however,
for the antiquarian’s conjecture, <i>Mr. Clift</i>, of the
College of Surgeons, has satisfactorily proved that
the bones in question are not human, but belong to
an animal of the genus <i>Bos</i>.</p>

And in this respect the common law<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> seems to
be agreeable to the <i>Mosaical</i>,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> which as to this purpose
is thus expressed. “If men strive and hurt a woman
with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and
yet no mischief follow, he shall surely be punished,
according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him,
and he shall pay as the judges determine; and if any
mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems also agreed, that where one counsels a
woman to kill her child when it shall be born, who
afterwards does kill it in pursuance of such advice, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>is an accessary to the murder.” <i>1 Hawk. P. C.</i> 121,
and authorities there cited.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the old law<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> there was this difference between
ordinary murder, and the murder of <i>bastard</i>
children, that in the latter case the <i>onus probandi</i> was
in some measure thrown upon the supposed criminal,
a practice totally at variance with our general principles
of justice; and though many fictions and judicial
evasions were resorted to for the purpose of
softening the extreme rigor of this statute,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> as by
supposing that very slight circumstances, as knocking
for help when in labour, providing linen, &amp;c.
took away the concealment,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> yet the law remained
in nominal force till the passing of the stat. 43 <i>Geo.</i>
3, <i>c.</i> 58, by which it is enacted that trials of women
for the murder of bastard children should proceed on
the same rules of evidence as trials for murder.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>This part of our subject, therefore, might have been
considered under the general head of murder; but
though the legal distinctions which marked the crime
of infanticide are thus removed, there are yet so many
peculiarities in the physiological mode of collecting
the evidence of its commission, that we have reserved
it for separate consideration, in conjunction with the
offence of procuring abortion to which it bears a close
affinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The case of the <i>King</i> v. <i>Phillips</i>, 3 <i>Campb. R.</i> <i>p.</i>
73, appears to have been the first that was tried
under the new law.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was an indictment on the 2d sect. of <i>Lord
Ellenborough’s</i> act, 43 <i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 58, for administering
<i>savin</i> to a woman <em>not</em> quick with child, for the
purpose of procuring abortion.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The first count of the indictment charged that the
prisoner on the 10th day of January 1811, and on
divers other days and times between that day and the
20th of March in the year aforesaid, at the parish of
St. Mary’s in the county of Monmouth, wilfully, maliciously,
unlawfully and feloniously did administer to
and cause to be administered to and taken by one <i>Hannah
Mary Goldsmith</i>, single woman, divers large
quantities, that is to say, 6 ounces of the <i>decoction</i> of
a certain shrub called <i>savin</i>, then and there being a
noxious and destructive thing, the said <i>H. M. G.</i> on
the said 10th day of January in the year aforesaid,
and continually from thence until the said 20th day of
March in the year aforesaid, at &amp;c. aforesaid, being
with child, but not quick with child, to wit, at the
respective times of administering such divers large
quantities of the <i>decoction</i> of the said shrub called
<i>savin</i> as aforesaid, with intent thereby to cause and
procure the miscarriage of the said <i>H. M. G.</i>, against
the form of the statute, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appeared that the prisoner prepared the medicine
which he administered to Miss <i>Goldsmith</i> by pouring
boiling water on the leaves of a shrub: and the medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>men examined, stated that such a preparation is
called <i>an infusion</i> not a <i>decoction</i>,—which is made by
boiling the substance in the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoner’s counsel insisted that he was entitled
to an acquittal on the ground that the medicine was
misdescribed.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lawrence, J.</i> This objection will not hold. The
infusion and decoction are <i>ejusdem generis</i>, and the
variance is immaterial. The question is, whether
the prisoner administered any matter or thing to this
woman with intent to procure abortion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Witnesses were called for the prisoner to prove that
the shrub he used was not <i>savin</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The counsel for the prosecution, insisted, that even
in that case the prisoner might be found guilty upon
the last count of the indictment, which charged that
he administered a large quantity “of a certain mixture
to the jurors unknown, <em>then and there being a
noxious and destructive thing</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoner’s counsel objected that unless the
shrub was <i>savin</i>, there was no evidence that the mixture
was “noxious and destructive.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lawrence, J.</i> In an indictment on this clause of the
statute, it was improper to introduce these words; and
although they are introduced, there is no necessity to
prove them. It is immaterial whether the shrub was
<i>savin</i> or not, or whether or not it was capable of procuring
abortion,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> or even whether the woman was
actually with child. If the prisoner believed at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>time that it would procure abortion, and administered
it with that intent, the case is within the statute, and
he is guilty of the offence laid to his charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoner urged that he had given the young
woman an innocent draught for the purpose of amusing
her, as she had threatened to destroy herself,
unless enabled to conceal her shame; and the Jury
returned a verdict of <em>not guilty</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoner had been previously tried on the <em>first</em>
section of the statute<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> for the capital charge, in
administering savin to Miss <i>Goldsmith</i> to procure abortion,
she being then quick with child.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> In point
of fact, she was in the fourth month of her pregnancy.
She swore, however, that she had not felt the child
move within her before taking the medicine, and that
she was not then quick with child. The medical men
in their examinations, differed as to the time when
the fœtus may be stated to be quick, and to have a
distinct existence; but they all agreed that in common
understanding, a woman is not considered to be quick
with child till she has herself felt the child alive and
quick within her, which happens with different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>women in different stages of pregnancy, although
most usually about the sixteenth or eighteenth week
after conception.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lawrence, J.</i> said, this was the interpretation that
must be put upon the words <em>quick with child</em> in the
statute; and as the woman in this case had not felt
the child alive within her before taking the medicine,—he
directed an acquittal.</p>

<p class='c000'>It cannot be necessary here to repeat that the popular
idea of quick or not quick with child is founded
in error;<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> yet as Acts of Parliament are not often
drawn, and seldom even reviewed previous to their
passing, by those whose profession, science, trade,
or business, would best enable them to convey their
meaning with distinctness; and as penal statutes must
be construed strictly, and according to the ordinary
and obvious meaning of the words, we must be content
to recognise a distinction in law which does not
exist in nature. There is, however, another peculiarity
in the two sections which are founded on this
distinction of <em>quick</em> or <em>not quick</em>, which calls for immediate
attention; in the first of these, that which applies
to women quick with child, and in which the offence is
made a capital felony, there is no mention of <em>using
any instrument or other means whatever</em>, but the crime
is confined to <em>administering</em> any deadly poison, or
other noxious and destructive substance or thing;
while in the clause against the minor offence the use
of <em>instruments or other means whatsoever</em> is expressly
included. Now we shall have occasion hereafter to
show that medicines internally administered can seldom
produce abortion, but that the effect can be infallibly
secured by instruments; the most probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>mode therefore of committing the crime appears to
be protected by the most penal clause.</p>

<p class='c000'>A case<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> on this point is inserted in the <cite>Edinburgh
Medical Journal</cite> for April, 1810; we entirely
concur in the sentiment of the editors; “we cannot,”
they say, “avoid remarking the apparent inconsistency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of the law of England, in having no statute to
punish its actual perpetration by the only certain
means of effecting it, while it punishes by death,
without benefit of clergy, the attempting it by means
which are very seldom effectual. Thus <i>Pizzy</i> was
tried for attempting to cause <i>Ann Cheney</i> to abort,
by giving her medicines, which had no effect; and
his having actually perpetrated the crime by mechanical
violence, was only brought forward as proving
the intention with which the medicines were given.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
The act therefore requires amendment, framed
however with such care, that the necessary practice
of procuring premature labour by qualified practitioners
may be defended, while the immoral and
criminal use of instrumental abortion may be adequately
punished.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>PHYSIOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Abortion.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Abortion<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> may be procured by the administration
of powerful medicines, or by the application of
mechanical violence, such as blows, or pressure on
the abdomen; or by the introduction of sharp instruments
into the uterus, so as to rupture the membranes.
We shall offer a few remarks upon each of these several
modes of accomplishing the criminal object in
question. From a very early period attempts have
been made to devise means of procuring abortion by
the administration of certain drugs, which were considered
as capable of acting specifically upon the
womb, and of occasioning the exclusion of its contents.
It would be idle to enumerate the various substances
which have, at different times, been employed
for such a purpose, not a few of which were derived
from the fertile sources of credulity and superstition;
and yet we are bound to admit, that upon this occasion
at least, credulity has proved a blessing to mankind,
by suggesting the substitution of a harmless
amulet, or an inefficacious drug, for an application
of extreme violence and danger, and, perhaps of
death. The physicians of the present age disclaim
the existence of any specific class of <i>abortives</i>, but we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>are ready to admit that the administration of violent
medicines, by involving the uterus in the general
shock thus given to the system, will occasion abortion,
provided there exist at the same time, a certain
predisposition on the part of the female; should this
latter condition, however, be wanting, the <i>poculum
abortionis</i> may, by the violence of its operation, destroy
the life of the unhappy mother, or very materially
injure her, without accomplishing the object for
which it was administered. In the case of <i>Mrs. Robert
Turner</i>, one of the persons poisoned by <i>Elizabeth
Fenning</i>, notwithstanding the long and violent sufferings
she had experienced during her pregnancy,
brought forth a living child at the natural period. On
the other hand, a grocer’s wife in Edinburgh, having
swallowed by mistake a handful of nitre, suffered
abortion in less than half an hour; and in the case of
<i>Mrs. Atwood</i>, of Mitcham, who with the rest of her
family was poisoned by mushrooms, as already related,
(<i>vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 431) although rescued from death, miscarried
in consequence of the violence which her general
system had sustained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The medicines more particularly employed for procuring
abortion are <i>savine</i>,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and other irritating
drugs, especially those which tend to excite a considerable
degree of vascular action; such medicines,
likewise, as exert a violent action on the stomach, or
bowels, will be likely to produce miscarriage, and
are often taken for such purpose in quantities sufficient
to produce fatal results. <i>Mr. Burns</i> observes
that it is an old remark that those purgatives which
occasion much tenesmus, will be more likely to excite
the expulsion of the ovum. The strong cathartics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>however, which are sometimes taken to promote such
an effect, not only act by exciting tenesmus, but likewise
by inflaming the stomach and bowels, and thus
affect the uterus in two ways. It cannot be too generally
known, adds the last mentioned author, that
when these medicines do produce abortion the mother
will seldom survive their effect. It is a mistaken notion
that abortion can be more readily excited by
drastic purges, immediately after the woman discovers
herself pregnant; on the contrary, the action of the
uterus is then more independent of that of the other
organs, and is therefore not so easily injured by
changes in their condition. Upon the same principle
that violent cathartics or emetics operate upon the
pregnant uterus, any other sudden shock upon the
body will occasion a similar effect on that organ; the
extraction of a tooth, for example, has been known
to produce abortion. A thunder-storm, or violent
cannonade, has been supposed to occasion the same result
by the concussion of the air; but <i>Mr. Burns</i> considers
it more probable that such an effect is owing to
mental trepidation. The influence of the passions
upon these occasions, such as fear and joy, especially
if suddenly produced, is too well known to require a
comment, and it has been too often artfully excited
for criminal purposes. The same observation will
apply to other violent impressions upon the body,
such as that occasioned by rapid and uneasy travelling,
dancing,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> walking, &amp;c. Blood-letting also,
if carried to any extent, will be liable to occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>miscarriage. <i>Belloc</i> relates a case in which these
means were criminally used for such a purpose; the
woman was bled by a medical practitioner, when,
after his departure, the bandage was removed, and a
farther quantity of blood taken. But all the modes
above related were soon discovered not only to be
highly dangerous to the woman, but extremely precarious
in their results; and hence a practice appears
to have early originated of ensuring the exclusion of
the ovum by the more direct and certain method of
introducing a stillet, or some sharp-pointed instrument
into the uterus; an allusion to an instrument
of this kind was made on the trial of <i>Charles Angus</i>
(<i>vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 177) and was described as a <em>silver tube with
a slide, at the end of which was a dart with three points</em>.
<i>Ovid</i><a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> appears to allude to this operation in the
following passage.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>——“sine crescere nata.</div>
      <div class='line'>Est pretium parvæ non leve vita moræ.</div>
      <div class='line'>Vestra quid effoditis subjectis viscera telis;</div>
      <div class='line'>Et nondum natis dira venena datis.”?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The practice is also reprobated by <i>Tertullian</i>,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
who has described the instrument with which the operation
of penetrating the ovular membranes was performed,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">est etiam æeneum spiculum quo jugulatio ipsa
dirigitur, cæco latrocinio</span></i> εμβρυοσφακτην <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">appellant, utique
viventis infantis peremptorium</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is hardly necessary to remark that such an operation,
unless performed by a skilful surgeon, will
be very liable <a id='to'></a>to endanger the life of the female. <i>Guy
Patin</i> relates the case of a midwife who was hanged
at Paris for occasioning the death of a lady in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>city, by an attempt to procure abortion by this method.
On her trial she said she had frequently practised
it with success; but, in this case it seems, the
instrument had pierced the body of the uterus, instead
of passing through the os internum. We have
already noticed a parallel case which occurred at
Durham, see <i>page</i> <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cases of criminal abortion the medical practitioner
may be called upon to deliver an opinion upon
the circumstances of the case. The data from which
he is to draw his conclusions have been already fully
investigated in different parts of this work. We must
therefore refer the reader to the Physiological Illustrations
of Conception and Parturition, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 230,
and to our directions for conducting the dissection of
the uterus, <i>vol.</i> iii, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>, for the solution of the different
problems to which the consideration of the
subject may give origin.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>INFANTICIDE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In cases of alleged infanticide, the evidence of the
<a id='for2'></a>forensic physician is of the highest importance, and
as his opinion upon such an occasion must necessarily
go far to influence the judgment, and direct the
verdict of the jury, he should be fully prepared to appreciate
the difficulties of the case, and to clear away
the numerous fallacies, and popular prejudices with
which the subject is embarrassed. To <i>Dr. William
Hunter</i>, the profession and the public owe the
deepest obligation, for the philosophical and humane
manner in which he examined the general value of
physiological testimony in proof of the commission of
child-murder. Previous to this enlightened dissertation<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
it is to be greatly feared that many unfortunate
women had fallen the innocent victims of false
theory and prejudice. The objections, however, so
forcibly urged by <i>Dr. Hunter</i> against the validity of
certain physiological tests, although well calculated
to awaken inquiry, in order to divest such evidence
of its fallacy, were not intended, as some have imagined,
to discard physiological testimony altogether.
With this conviction, we shall proceed to a critical
examination of the various proofs which physiology
has been supposed capable of affording, in support of
an accusation of infanticide.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The objects of this inquiry may be conveniently arranged
under four divisions, viz.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. <i>To ascertain whether the child was born alive?</i></p>

<p class='c017'>2. <i>If born alive, whether its death was the result of
natural causes; of wilful murder; or of negligence
and abandonment?</i></p>

<p class='c017'>3. <i>If its death arose from the want of due care,
whether such negligence should be regarded as
criminal or accidental?</i></p>

<p class='c017'>4. <i>Whether the woman accused presents on examination,
such appearances as correspond with her
supposed relations to the child?</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Upon each of these heads we shall offer such observations
as appear to us to be essential to ensure
the safe judgment of the practitioner. Several of the
questions, involved in the inquiry, have already engaged
our attention in the first volume of the present
work, under the history of conception; while the industry
with which the numerous authorities on the
subject of infanticide, and its scientific relations,
have been lately collated by <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i>,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> in
England, and <i>Professor Capuron</i>, in France, will
justify us in giving to this branch of our work the character
of a commentary, rather than that of a regular
history.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the discovery of the body of a newly-born infant,
it becomes our first duty to ascertain whether
the spark of life be entirely extinct; if the sensible
proofs of absolute death should be absent, no time is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to be lost in subjecting it to those means<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> which
are best calculated to excite it to vigorous life, such
as external warmth, frictions, inflation of the lungs,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having satisfied ourselves that the child is dead,
we are to proceed to such inquiries, as may enable
us to furnish the best possible evidence on the case,
in a court of judicature, viz.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>1. <i>To ascertain whether the Child was born alive?</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In the absence of all direct testimony, our investigation
is to be conducted upon principles very similar
to those which we have already recommended in
those obscure cases of death in which “the person is
found dead, and the history of his dissolution is unknown.”
See <i>vol.</i> iii, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>. The appearances of the
corpse—the character of the spot in which it was
found—the report of competent witnesses—and the
phenomena displayed on dissection, are, in both
cases, the circumstances from which we are to elicit
data for the solution of our difficult problem.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. <i>The inspection of the body of the infant.</i> By this
we are first to learn, whether it had arrived at that
degree of maturity which is essential for enabling it
to sustain an independent existence—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etoit il viable?</span></i>”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
If it can be fairly shewn that the child had not
reached the end of the seventh month of uterine gestation,
the charge of infanticide ought to be withdrawn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>although we are well aware that various opinions
might be cited in support of a contrary position.
(See <cite>Physiological Illustrations</cite>, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 243.) The
weight of the child is a circumstance which should
always be ascertained, as being capable of throwing
some light on the question at issue. If the fœtus has
passed the period of seven months, it will generally
weigh four pounds, although upon this point again a
difference of opinion has unfortunately existed.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The length of the fœtus, at the full term, is said
to vary less than its weight. It is generally from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>nineteen to twenty-two inches. Seventeen and
twenty-six will include the two extremes. <i>Professor
Chaussier</i> has presented us with a scale of relative
admeasurements, from which he thinks we may deduce
the age of a child. He asserts that at the full
term of gestation, the middle of the body of the
fœtus corresponds exactly with the umbicus; at the
eighth month it is two or three centimeters higher;
that it approaches still nearer the sternum at the
seventh month; and at the sixth falls exactly at the abdominal
extremity of that bone.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> If this statement
is to be relied upon, we should be able to conclude,
says <i>Dr. Smith</i>, that when the middle of the length
of the body falls at the cartilago ensiformis, the fœtus
must be under the seventh month, and consequently
could not have continued to live after birth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The surface of the fœtus will moreover present an
appearance, arising from its great vascularity, which
is very characteristic of its immaturity; the red hue,
however, to which we more particularly allude, is
not acquired until the vessels have attained a certain
capacity, and the circulation a considerable degree
of vigour; and it is worthy of remark that the appearance
becomes again obscure, as the developement
of the fœtus advances, from the increasing opacity
of the integuments, but in those parts where the
deposition of fat in the cellular membrane is wanting,
the redness will remain conspicuous, as in the palms
of the hands, or in the soles of the feet. The head
still maintains an unjust proportion to the rest of the
body; the bones of which it consists are extremely
soft and yielding; and, on account of the extent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the fontanelles, the connection between them is extremely
imperfect. The eye-lids are closed; the hair
on the eye-brows and the eye-lashes but thinly scattered;
the pupil is generally closed by a membrane;
the nails are wanting, or scarcely apparent. The
sexual organs will also afford some characteristic appearances.
In the male, the testes, between the
sixth and eighth month are in progress towards the
scrotum; at the end of the seventh they are not yet
found there. The scrotum is generally of a bright
red colour. In females the vulva is projecting, and
the labia separated by the protuberance of the clitoris.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general external appearance of a fœtus may,
moreover, indicate the important fact of its having
been retained in the uterus after its death. <i>Lecieux</i>
observes that the ordinary term which it remains in
the womb, in this state, is from five to twenty days;
and that, according to the length of this period, the
body will have lost more or less of its consistence and
firmness; the limbs become lax, and the muscles are
readily torn; the epidermis may be removed by the
slightest friction; the skin also assumes a purplish,
or brownish-red colour; there is often some bloody
serum effused in the cellular tissue, just beneath the
skin, especially about the cranium;<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> the umbilical
cord is large in circumference, soft, infiltrated with
serum, livid, and is very readily torn; the thorax is
flattened, the head falls into different shapes, and
becomes flattened from its own weight; the membranes
which serve as a bond of union to the several
bones of the cranium, are much relaxed. The brain
is in a nearly fluid state, and emits a fetid odour.</p>

<p class='c000'>We should next proceed to a more minute and particular
inspection of the external appearances; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>which purpose the body should be cleansed from the
dirt and impurities with which it may be invested,
taking care to notice upon this occasion, whether the
surface be covered with that sebaceous matter usually
present on the skin of newly-born infants, and whether
any mud or other matter, capable of stopping the
mouth and nostrils be found about them. The head
should also be shaved, in order that the fontanelles
and sutures may be carefully examined with a view
to ascertain whether any injury had been committed
on the brain through these avenues. A midwife was
executed at Paris for having introduced fine and
sharp wires into these parts, before the heads of the
unfortunate infants were expelled from the vagina,
and consequently before respiration could have taken
place. Every appearance of ecchymosis, or wound,
should be inspected with attention, in order that its
true character may be verified; and upon this occasion
it will be important to bear in mind that on the
surface of dead bodies, especially on those parts on
which they have lain, superficial livid marks, arising
from stagnation of blood in the small vessels of the
skin will very generally present themselves, and
which have received the name of <i>sugillations</i>, in contradistinction
to that of <i>ecchymoses</i>, which are produced
during the life of the individual. As the people,
observes <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i>, are apt to regard the
former of these discolourations as signs of violence,
and as such propositions have even been maintained
in courts of judicature, it is highly essential to obviate
the possibility of litigation on this point, by removing
a layer of the skin where such lividness is present,
to shew that it is confined to this organ, and is not
attended with infiltration of blood in the cellular
tissue.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The appearance of wounds inflicted during life
will vary according to the length of time the subject
has survived. If death takes place immediately, they
will present red and bloody surfaces, with ecchymosis.
Should life have lingered for some hours,
their edges will be somewhat tumid and retracted,
and the surrounding skin will display a reddish appearance;
clots of blood may also exist in them, and
these will be found to adhere to their surfaces. In
those cases in which several days elapse before death,
they may appear bedewed with purulent matter.
<i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> very justly remarks that wounds,
made when the circulation has ceased, and the body
become cold; and when the blood has coagulated
in the vessels, and the muscles have become rigid,
may be known to have been inflicted after death
by the pallid appearance of their surfaces, and by the
total absence of tumefaction and retraction; such
wounds, moreover, never contain any adherent clots
of blood, and there is no surrounding ecchymosis.
These characters may not perhaps be quite so distinct,
where the violence has been effected immediately
after death, while the body is still warm, the
blood fluid, and the muscles endowed with contractility;
yet in this latter case there will neither appear
tumefaction, nor ecchymosis; and the blood, which
may have oozed from the divided surfaces, will remain
fluid, or form clots not adherent to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Contusions</i>, effected during life, are always accompanied
with more or less of ecchymosis; and, if produced
by severe external violence, the skin will necessarily
be involved in the injury. When ecchymosis
is superficial, and the subject outlives its course,
its progress and decline present highly characteristic
phenomena; at first the injured surface presents a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>spot of a red, or bluish colour; this spot which is
formed by the blood infiltrated into the cellular tissue,
soon assumes a deep livid, or leaden hue; it then
after a few days becomes, successively, violet, yellowish,
and terminates by a pale citron colour. It is
generally seven or eight days before it disappears.
These characters will always enable the anatomist to
distinguish contusions made during life, from those
occurring after death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The state of the cervical vertebræ should also be
carefully examined, for the death of the infant may
have been occasioned by a fatal luxation, produced
perhaps by some sudden contortion of the neck. Any
marks of pressure, or violence about this part should
therefore be carefully noted; and it will be obviously
more convenient to examine the spine, before the
large cavities of the bodies are exposed; and which
may be accomplished in the following manner. After
dissecting the soft parts from the vertebræ, the dorsal
parts may be readily removed by scissars, while
the apophyses of the true vertebræ can be very easily
cut through. The practitioner will thus be enabled
to estimate the nature and extent of any wound, or
laceration, or effusion of blood, that may be discovered
in connection with the spinal marrow. The
appearance and condition of the umbilical cord should
also be examined before any of the great cavities are
laid open; for it is obvious where a ligature has not
been properly applied to it, death may have arisen as
the result of hemorrhage from this part. Other reasons
also exist which render such an inspection of the
greatest importance.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
  <h5 class='c014'><i>Phœnomena displayed on the dissection of the internal parts.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The ample directions which have been already offered
upon this subject, (<i>vol.</i> iii, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>) will in a great
degree supersede the necessity of very minute details
on the present occasion. There are, however, some
few phenomena that exclusively relate to the evidence
of infanticide, and must accordingly receive a
due share of our attention. Certain peculiarities,
moreover, exist in the mode of conducting the dissection
of an infant, which demand some explanation.</p>

<h6 class='c014'><i>Cavities of the mouth, œsophagus, larynx, and trachea.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>It will be adviseable to commence our incision
through the integuments, from the under lip to the
top of the sternum, passing quite through the former
part; another incision is to follow the inferior margin
of the lower jaw; then the triangular portions
thus marked out are to be separated from the parts
beneath; the head should be bent back in order to
put the soft parts that are to come under the knife
upon the stretch. The jaw may now be divided at
its symphysis, so as to separate it into two lateral
portions, which may be turned aside by dividing with
a scalpel all the parts which adhere to its internal
surface. The object of this arrangement is to bring
into view the cavities of the mouth, œsophagus, larynx,
and trachea, the condition of which is so frequently
connected with the death of the child that
they ought never to escape examination. The position
of the tongue should be noticed, and the contents
of the mouth, if any, ought to be recorded, for
cases have occurred in which extraneous matters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>such as mud, sand, feathers, &amp;c. have been accidentally,
or criminally introduced. It will at the same
time be extremely proper to ascertain the state of the
nasal cavities, and to observe the quantity and consistence
of the mucus in these parts, as well as in the
fauces. The tongue may now be gradually pulled
downwards, until the isthmus of the fauces is stretched,
when, by cutting through the arch of the palate,
the whole of the pharynx will be exposed; the dissection
should then be extended in order to bring the
commencement of the œsophagus into view, which
should be carefully examined. The position of the
epiglottis is the next object of inspection; and lastly,
the interior of the larynx and trachea may be disclosed
by making an incision through the thyroid,
crycoid, and tracheal cartilages, at their anterior
parts. Ligatures should be placed on the lower
parts of the œsophagus and trachea.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Thoracic cavity.</i> Having accomplished the examination
above described, we may proceed to expose
the cavities of the thorax and abdomen, in the manner
already explained, (<i>vol.</i> iii, <i>p.</i> <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>) remembering always
that, by carelessly wounding the thoracic viscera, we
shall, in a great degree, defeat the objects of the dissection;
on this account it will be advisable to
make the division of the ribs with scissars, instead of
a scalpel. From the examination of these cavities we
shall, in the first place, derive a confirmation, or refutation,
of the opinion respecting the maturity, or
<i>viabilité</i> of the subject, which the external view of
the body had suggested. Previous to the end of the
seventh month the heart will be found exceeding in
size its just proportions, and without much difference
of capacity between the auricles and ventricles.
The lungs will appear small, solid, and retracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>from the anterior part of the cavity. In the abdomen
we shall find the liver very considerable in size, and
situated near the umbilicus, from which it afterwards
gradually recedes as the fœtus advances. The gall-bladder
will be found to contain a nearly colourless
serous fluid, which during the eighth month gradually
becomes yellowish, and acquires a bitter taste.
If the appearances above described be compared with
those which are displayed on the dissection of a full
grown fœtus, we shall be able to form a very just
estimate of the value of an anatomical investigation,
in discovering the term of its intra-uterine or fœtal
life. But, by the inspection of the thoracic organs,
we endeavour to derive an inference still more important;
the state of the lungs is supposed to be capable
of indicating whether respiration have ever
been performed; and, consequently, whether the
child was born alive. It is affirmed that the lungs of
the fœtus are small, not filling the cavities of the
chest, or covering the pericardium; dense; compact;
of a deep-red, or chocolate colour, not unlike
that of the liver; carrying but little blood, and having
a specific gravity exceeding that of fresh water,
and, consequently, <em>sinking</em> in that fluid. Upon cutting
into them no air will be emitted, nor will any
blood follow the incision. When, however, respiration
has been established, these organs become
more voluminous, present a yielding elastic texture,
and assume a florid-red colour; they, moreover, contain
and transmit a larger quantity of blood, and
have a specific gravity less than that of fresh water,
and accordingly <em>float</em> in it. On cutting into the lungs,
under these circumstances, the air contained in their
cells will escape, and produce a peculiar crackling
noise, which has been well expressed by the term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span><i>crepitating</i>; a bloody fluid will at the same time
exude.</p>

<p class='c000'>That a change in the character of the pulmonary
structure so important as that just described should
have attracted the notice of the physiologist, and been
eagerly seized, as evidence in proof of the infant
<em>having respired</em>, and therefore been <em>born alive</em>, cannot
be a matter of surprise; and we accordingly find that
the <i>hydrostatic test</i> long enjoyed the unreserved confidence
of the profession and the public. Whenever an
infant was found dead, under circumstances of doubt
and suspicion, its lungs were removed from the body,
and immersed in water; if they sank, the subject of
the experiment was immediately declared to have
been still-born. If, on the contrary, they floated, it
was concluded without farther enquiry, that the infant
had lived after its birth. The aphorism of <i>Baglivi</i>
may be received as an expression of the general
feeling so long entertained upon this subject. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulmones
fœtus mortui in utero matris, si extrahantur, et
in aqua ponantur, petunt fundum; mortui vero extra
uterum et aqua injecti innatent in ea. Quod signum ad
infanticidia detegenda est evidentissimum.</span></i>”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> The
number of innocent females who may have been thus
sacrificed through a physiological conceit, is a circumstance
that must excite the most awful reflection.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
It is now well ascertained, and as generally
admitted, that the validity of the <i>hydrostatic test</i>, as
usually applied, must afford very unquestionable indications.
<i>Bohn</i>,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> <i>Hoffman</i>,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and <i>Heister</i>,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>have shewn that the lungs of a fœtus, born dead,
will under some circumstances, to be hereafter explained,
float in water; while those of one that has
lived after its birth may sink in the same fluid. <i>Dr.
Gordon Smith</i> is inclined to attribute <em>some</em> of the uncertainty,
by which the minds of medical men have
been obscured with regard to the pulmonary tests, to
confusion in the method of conducting the experiment,
for there is, says he, but one order in which
the steps can be taken, and if the anatomist should
inadvertently resort to one stage of the process before
another that should have preceded, he will baffle
his own efforts. In commencing an examination of
the thoracic organs, we should, previous to the disturbance
of the parts, notice whether any morbid appearances
present themselves, such as adhesions between
the lungs and the pleura costalis, &amp;c. We
should at the same time observe whether the lungs be
collapsed, or dilated, and whether they cover the
lateral parts of the pericardium. We then proceed
to separate the pulmonary organs from the body, in
order to submit them to the <i>hydrostatic test</i>, to which
we have adverted. For the performance of this dissection,
<i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> has given us so many complete
and satisfactory directions, that we shall here
introduce them for the instruction of the forensic physician.
“Ligatures must be placed on the aorta and
venæ cavæ, near their attachment to the heart; the
trachea is then to be removed close to the bronchiæ;
the vessels cut beyond the ligatures; and the heart
and lungs, attached together, removed from the cavity
of the thorax. If bloody, they should be cleansed
with a sponge; and then the colour of the lungs,
their consistence and elasticity, and their state with
regard to healthy structure, be distinctly noticed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>without compressing them forcibly, or lacerating
in any way their structure. If the body generally be
in a state of putrid decomposition, it should be ascertained
whether the lungs are also thus affected, and
in what degree. A livid colour from congestion of
dark coloured blood in the minute vessels, should
not be mistaken for gangrene; an appearance of this
kind seems often to have the same origin as the lividness
of the surface of dead bodies. The lungs are to
be turned with the bronchial trunks downwards, that
any fluid which may be contained in these tubes may
flow out; and whatever escapes from them should be
preserved in a clean vessel. These organs are then
to be weighed in conjunction with the heart. A vessel,
of a foot or a little more in diameter, and of at
least a foot and a half in depth, is to be filled to the
height of not less than a foot with pure <em>fresh</em>, and if
possible, <em>river</em> water, the temperature of which should
be nearly equal to that of the air, unless this be very
cold or very hot. The lungs and heart, still attached
together, are to be placed in a gentle manner in this
water. It must then be remarked, whether they
float near the surface, or sink to the bottom; whether
they fall suddenly, or descend slowly; whether the
lungs turn uppermost, and float near the surface of
the water, or about the middle of the fluid.</p>

<p class='c000'>The heart is now to be separated from the lungs,
having previously applied a ligature to the pulmonary
vessels, to prevent the escape of the blood they
may contain; and the weight of the heart alone then
determined, that it may be subtracted from that of
the heart and lungs together, as previously ascertained.
The lungs are now to be placed alone in the
water, and great attention must be paid to the position
they assume in it; that is, whether they sink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>rapidly or slowly, or float near the surface; whether,
by reversing their vertical situation in the water,
they sink more readily or with more difficulty; and,
if any part constantly rises and is drawn under water
by the rest, this part should be particularly marked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two lobes must be separated, and the above-mentioned
experiment made with each distinctly, and
any difference in the results remarked; if one lobe
float, and the other sink, it should be noticed whether
it is the right or left that floats. Each lobe is then
to be cut into several pieces, taking care not to confuse
those of the right with those of the left.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having examined the physiological principles upon
which the <i>hydrostatic test</i> is established, and explained
the manner in which it is to be conducted, it remains
for us to enumerate the several objections
which have been urged against its validity.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>A fœtus may breathe as soon as its head is without
the vagina, and immediately die.</i>—This is one of
the great arguments adduced by <i>Dr. Hunter</i>;<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a> “a
child,” says he, “will very commonly breathe as
soon as its mouth is born, or protruded from the
mother, and in that case may lose its life before its
body be born; especially when there happens to be a
considerable interval of time between what we may
call the birth of the child’s head, and the protrusion
of its body. And, if this may happen when the best
assistance is at hand, it is still more likely to happen
where there is none; that is, where the woman is delivered
by herself;” and he adds, “if a child makes
but one gasp, and instantly dies, the lungs will swim
in water as readily as if it had breathed longer, and
had then been strangled.” This opinion, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>must not be received without qualification. We admit
that under such circumstances a portion of the
lungs will become inflated, and therefore swim in
water; but it would appear from the more precise
and comprehensive views of later physiologists, that
respiration is not completely performed on the first
effort, but that it is a process gradually advancing to
perfection; and that it will be more or less protracted
according to the degree of vigour of which the infant
is possessed. <i>Portal</i> has shewn by experiments<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
that the air enters the <em>right</em> lung sooner than the
left, and that the left lobe is very often not at all dilated
for several days. The same fact was observed
by <i>Blancardi</i>.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> states that he was
informed by a late physician to the Foundling-hospital
at Naples, who opened daily, on an average, the
bodies of ten or twelve infants, which had generally
died within twenty-four hours after birth, that he
hardly ever found more than a very small portion of
the lungs dilated by air; this portion was frequently
not larger than a walnut in its green shell, and but
rarely larger than a hen’s egg, and it was commonly
situate in the <em>right</em> lung.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a> “I have seen,” continues
the author above cited, “a case where the <em>right</em>
lobe, when separated from the left, sank in water,
though this was the most dilated by respiration, and
the infant had lived forty hours, and cried pretty
strongly: but it died from suffocation by being <em>overlaid</em>,
as it is popularly termed, by the mother, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>had produced such an engorgement of blood in the
lungs, as to counterbalance the influence which the
small quantity of air they contained could have exerted
on their specific gravity. A piece somewhat more
than a cubic inch in volume was the greatest portion
that in this case floated in water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>The lungs may have been artificially inflated.</i>—It
is so generally known, observes <i>Dr. Hunter</i>, that a
child born apparently dead may be brought to life by
inflating its lungs, that the mother herself, or some
other person, might have tried the experiment. It
might even have been done with a most diabolical intention
of bringing about the condemnation of the
mother. There exists not a doubt but that such an
operation would impart buoyancy to the lungs, although
the fact has been doubted. <i>Camper</i>, <i>Jager</i>,
<i>Schmitt</i>, and <i>Buttner</i> decided the question by numerous
experiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>The lungs may float, in consequence of putrefaction.</i>—We
have stated on a former occasion that the
buoyancy of the human body is materially influenced
by the putrefactive process, (<i>vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 40.) <i>Haller</i>
procured the lungs of a child that died before its
birth. They were of a dark red colour, and both
when entire, and when cut in pieces, sank in water.
A portion being left to putrefy in water, the colour
became brighter, it was covered with air bubbles,
ascended gradually as the process of putrefaction advanced,
and at length reached the surface, where it
continued to float. But in answer to the objection
which such a fact would seem to oppose to the validity
of the <i>hydrostatic test</i>, let it be remembered that
the lungs are particularly unsusceptible of the putrefactive
process, and resist it longer than any of the
soft parts. So that the body must be very far advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>in decomposition before the lungs are found
to participate in it. <i>Camper</i> instituted a number
of experiments upon infants, at Amsterdam, by exposing
their bodies to the action of water, as well as
to that of air, and his results fully confirm the fact
we have just stated. <i>Ballard</i> was called upon to
examine a child, the muscles of whose face were reduced
to “<i>boulli</i>”—were in a state of solution—and in
which putrefaction had advanced so far as even to prevent
discrimination of the sex, notwithstanding which
the lungs immediately sunk. If we make incisions
into these organs, when in a state of advanced putrefaction,
we shall observe air bubbles of a considerable
size, and running in lines along the fissures,
between the component <i>lobuli</i> of the lungs; where
such phenomena present themselves we may be assured,
says <i>Dr. Hunter</i>, that the air is emphysematous,
and not that which has been introduced by respiration;
for, in this latter case, the air bubbles will
be hardly visible to the naked eye. But there still
remains another mode by which we may determine
whether the gas diffused in the texture of the pulmonary
organs be the effect of respiration, or decomposition.
It consists in pressing portions of the lungs
between the fingers, or twisting them in a folded
cloth, with all the force we can command; when,
should the gas have arisen from putrefaction, the
portions thus treated will sink in water; a change
which no force, however powerful, will effect in
those cases where the gaseous distention has arisen
from respiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the view which we have taken of the <i>hydrostatic</i>
test, and of the objections which have been
urged against its validity, the practitioner will be
enabled to appreciate its importance. <i>Plouquet</i>, desirous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of procuring additional evidence, respecting
the existence of respiration, from the condition of the
pulmonary organs, proposed a test founded on the
<em>absolute</em> weight of the lungs compared with that of
the body. Respiration produces two important
changes in them—by inflating their texture it <em>diminishes</em>
their <i>specific gravity</i>; and by promoting a determination
of blood to their vessels, it increases
their <em>absolute</em> weight; upon the former of these
changes, the <i>hydrostatic test</i> is founded, as we have
already explained; on the latter, <i>Professor Plouquet</i>
endeavoured to found his “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nova Docimasia
Pulmonaris</span></i>,” which is now very generally known by
the name of <i>Plouquet’s test</i>, or <i>assay</i>. The blood-vessels,
observes this distinguished physiologist,
being collapsed and compressed in the lungs of the
fœtus, admit only a small portion of blood; but after
respiration, being dilated, and extended, and more
free in the expanded lungs, they receive a greater
quantity; in consequence of which they become still
farther expanded, and of greater calibre. As this
increased capacity of the vessels is necessarily <em>permanent</em>,
a greater quantity of blood will remain after
death in the arteries and veins, and more especially
in the latter, than in the lungs of those infants who
have never respired, and consequently the <em>absolute
weight of the lungs must be increased</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conformity with these views, <i>Plouquet</i> found on
examination, that the body of a male infant, born
dead, and which had not respired, weighed 53040
grains, the lungs inclusive; and that these latter organs
alone weighed 792 grains; the proportion of the
lungs to the body, in weight, was therefore in this
case as 1 to 67. In another infant, under similar circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>he found the proportion as 1 to 70. On
examining an infant, born at the full period, and
which had respired, the proportion was found to be
as 2 to 70, so that the weight of the lungs was absolutely
doubled by the act of respiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be a loss of time to enumerate the different
objections which have been urged against the validity
of this test, on various grounds, many of which admit
of an easy answer. It is sufficient to state that experiments,
subsequent to those of <i>Plouquet</i>, by <i>Haartman</i>,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
<i>Struve</i>,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a> <i>Schmitt</i>, and <i>Lecieux</i>,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a> have
shewn that no constant relation between the weight
of the lungs and that of the body, under the circumstances
above mentioned, can be established. The
reason of which, as <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> has justly observed,
without considering the influence of variation
in the original construction of the body, is sufficiently
accounted for, by the great diversity in the manner
in which respiration is established in new-born infants.
We have already stated that, in a great proportion
of them, it is but gradually and slowly effected;
and that several days even may elapse before the
lungs are fully dilated. <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i><a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a> is disposed
to believe that data might be obtained for a just
conclusion upon this point, if practitioners would institute
farther inquiry into the subject; and, with
this impression, he has been induced to enter more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>fully into the history of the test, than we deem necessary,
believing as we do, that it can never afford
evidence sufficiently decisive for practical application.
<i>Daniel</i> has proposed a modification of <i>Plouquet’s</i> test,
but which is more objectionable even than that which
he professes to improve. The same physiologist considers
that an inference may be drawn from the increased
circumference of the thorax, and the vaulted
appearance it assumes after respiration. The objections
urged by <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> to these latter indications
appear to us to be unanswerable; the circumference
of the thorax, says he, varies so much in infants
of the same age and sex, both absolutely and in proportion
to other parts of their body, that it cannot be
possible to obtain any decisive evidence from it. The
vaulted appearance of the chest is almost equally fallacious
in the generality of cases, or else it is devoid
of utility; because the figure of the thoracic parietes
is not much changed until respiration has been fully
established, and then we have other and more certain
means of detecting its existence. Besides which, it
appears from the experiments of <i>Schmitt</i>, that the
thoracic parietes were distended outwards by artificial
insufflation after death, as much as they are by actual
respiration as it occurs in the new-born infant.
With these remarks we shall dismiss the subject of
<i>Docimasia Pulmonaris</i>, and proceed to inquire whether
the structure of the heart is capable of affording
any useful indications. There can be no doubt but
that, some time after birth, we shall find on inspecting
the heart, evident marks of the altered course of
the circulation. The <i>foramen ovale</i> will be closed,
and in extending our examination, we shall find that
the <i>ductus arteriosus</i> and <i>canalis venosus</i>, have collapsed
and assumed the appearance of imperforated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>ligaments; but it must be remembered that such
changes require some time for their completion, and
in cases where the child has perished shortly after its
birth, we do not believe that the alteration in structure
will be sufficiently obvious to afford any information
of practical application. The degree of importance
which is to be attached to the arched state of the
diaphragm has been already appreciated. The empty
state of the urinary bladder and intestines has been
alluded to by some authors, as affording a degree of
presumptive evidence, since the evacuation of the
urine from the former, and that of the <i>meconium</i> from
the latter, are performed by most living children
soon after birth. We are, however, inclined to attach
but very little importance to such indications;
and with regard to the <i>meconium</i>, every practitioner
in midwifery knows well that it is frequently evacuated
by the pressure of the maternal parts on the
child during its passage through the pelvis; especially
in breech presentations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stomach and intestines ought, in every case, to
be considered as important objects of examination.
It is possible that the trace of some aliment may be
discovered, if so, no further proof can be required as
to the child having lived. If any thing more than
simple mucous fluid exist in the stomach, it should be
examined by chemical tests. This remark, which we
owe to <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i>, applies especially to the possibility
of poison having been exhibited; and on this
point the mucous membrane of the stomach will furnish
useful evidence. If there should appear any
fluid in this viscus, resembling water, it will be necessary
to examine its nature, and to ascertain if any
vegetable matters be present in it, such as portions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>weeds, straw, &amp;c. In our examination we should
always keep in mind the possibility of the child having
been destroyed by <em>drowning</em>, <em>strangulation</em>, <em>poisoning</em>,
and the <em>infliction of wounds</em>, subjects which
we have already so fully discussed in the second volume
of our work, that we do not consider it necessary
to dwell upon them in this place.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The cranial cavity.</i>—For the examination of this
part <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> has given us some very minute
and valuable instructions, of which we shall avail
ourselves. The cranial cavity, he observes, should
be exposed, by making, in the first instance, an incision
through the integuments of the skull, penetrating
to the bone, from the root of the nose to the spinous
process of the second or third cervical vertebra;
another incision of the same kind should extend from
one ear to the other, passing transversely over the
summit of the head. Each of the four triangular portions
of integuments thus formed, should then be detached
from the cranium, beginning at their apex
and terminating at their base. The temporal and occipital
muscles should then be separated in a similar
manner. After examining the state of the cranium,
the bones may be removed by dividing the membranous
connection between the parietal, frontal, temporal,
and occipital bones, with scissars. This, however,
should be done without lesion of the vessels of
the brain, or of the venous sinuses; in order to avoid
the lateral sinus which always contains fluid blood,
and which is situated very near the mastoidean angle
of the parietal bone, <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> directs the anatomist,
when the point just indicated is approached,
to deviate a little from the membrane, and to cut the
parietal bone itself near its margin. In the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>place, the view of the brain will afford presumptive
evidence of its age; previous to the termination of
the sixth month it will appear as a soft mass, equally
white throughout its whole extent; in the eighth
month the cerebral substance will have acquired more
consistence, its interior will present a reddish colour,
although its surface still remains white. The <i>pia mater</i>,
which in the earlier stages seemed only to be
over its surface, will now be found adherent to it;
and some of those grooves and undulations become
apparent, which afterwards constitute the circumvolutions.
In pursuing the dissection of the brain, the
practitioner must be careful in noting every morbid
appearance, such as congestions, extravasations, &amp;c.,
for the cause of death may have arisen from the injured
structure of these parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>C. <i>The character of the spot in which the body was
found</i> will often afford presumptive evidence of considerable
weight, but in availing ourselves of its indications,
we must cautiously avoid the fallacies to
which it may give origin; to some of which we shall
have occasion to refer at a future period of the investigation.
We next proceed to the consideration of
the several problems involved in the second division
of our inquiry, viz.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>II. <i>Whether, supposing the child to have been born alive, its death was the result of natural causes, of wilful violence, or of negligence and abandonment?</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>If sufficient proof should have been obtained that
the child was born alive, we have to inquire into
the causes of its death; upon which the anatomical
dissection will have thrown some light, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>a great measure, prepared our decision. Medical
writers on the subject of infanticide have very judiciously
considered the modes of violent death in new-born
children, as divisible into two great classes, viz.
those of <em>omission</em>, and those of <em>commission</em>. It will be
convenient for us, on the present occasion, to arrange
our remarks with reference to such a division.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Death by omission.</i>—For want of due care the child
may perish during, or immediately subsequent to,
the labour. It may die from suffocation caused by
the viscid mucus naturally existing about the pharynx
and glottis in newly-born infants getting into
the trachea, especially <em>if the infant has lain on its back
for some time after its delivery</em>; or suffocation may be
occasioned by the discharge of blood from the mother,
or by the wet linen over it, collapsing and excluding
the air, or by being drawn close to its mouth and
nose by the suction of breathing. Children are,
moreover, often born with a portion of the membranes
over the face, which, if not removed, must
impede respiration. In some cases strangulation is
produced by the umbilical cord; the livid circle therefore
round the neck, which without due consideration,
might seem to afford a proof of criminal violence,
is to be regarded with reference to the probability
of such an occurrence; it is possible, adds <i>Dr.
Hutchinson</i>, that the navel-string may be twisted
round the neck of the infant, but loosely, until the
body is nearly expelled; and then, if the placenta
be firmly retained in the uterus, it may become
tightened, and cause suffocation. These circumstances
may happen when there is no person about
the woman to render her proper assistance; and,
therefore, careful examination is necessary, in order
to ascertain, if, with the livid circle round the neck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>there are marks of nails, or points of fingers, or excoriation
of the skin. The breadth of the mark, also,
and whether or not it makes a complete circle, with
the ends exactly meeting, and without deviating from
this circle, should be carefully noticed; the latter
circumstances conjoined cannot arise from a natural
twisting of the navel string. The livid part should
be carefully dissected, in order to ascertain if there
are ruptured blood-vessels corresponding to it, whether
the trachea or larynx be flattened, or their cartilaginous
rings laterally compressed; for it is asserted
that such injuries never can occur from the natural
twisting of the navel string. The practitioner will
be enabled by the foregoing remarks to appreciate
the value of that indication, upon which the vulgar
have ever laid much stress,—the swollen and red appearance
of the countenance. <i>Dr. Hunter</i> has made
the following judicious observation upon the phenomenon:
“when the child’s head or face looks swollen,
and very red or black, the vulgar, because hanged
people look so, are apt to conclude that it must have
been strangled. But those who are in the practice
of midwifery know that nothing is more common in
natural births; and that the swelling and deep colour
disappear gradually, if the child lives but a few
days. This appearance is particularly observable in
those cases where the navel-string happens to gird
the child’s neck, and where its head happens to be
born some time before its body.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A woman suffering labour alone may have the fœtus
escape from her, and fall to the ground, on its head,
and be thus killed; or she may unexpectedly be seized
with pains in situations at once destructive to the
child. In the case of infants being found in privies,
this circumstance ought not to escape our remembrance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>A woman was tried at the Old Bailey for
the murder of her child, by dropping it into a privy.
She declared that while there for a natural purpose,
an uncommon pain took her, the child fell, and she
sat some time before she was able to stir. On this occasion,
we learn from <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>, that a
practitioner was examined on the possibility of such
an event; who stated that an instance came within
his own knowledge, where, while the midwife was
playing at cards in the room, the woman was taken
suddenly, and the child dropped on the floor. To
this the author just cited adds another illustrative
case. It recently happened, says he, in the circle of
my own acquaintance, that a lady who had borne
many children, and must therefore have been alive to
the import of uneasiness in the last hours of pregnancy,
was sitting in company at dinner, and perfectly
free from any consciousness of approaching labour,
when she experienced an irresistible impulse to
repair to the water-closet. She had scarcely arrived
there when she was delivered: now had the place of
retirement been differently constructed, this infant
might have perished. It will very properly be urged
that a woman, on finding what has happened, ought,
if her feelings and intentions were honest, to give
immediate alarm. This is true, but says <i>Dr. Smith</i>,
we must admit, in the first place, the possibility of
her not being able to do so, in consequence of the
effects of the occurrence on her own person; and, in
the next place, it is but just to allow that, although
an alarm, after she has fully recovered, might secure
her in the case of trial, yet as it can be of no use in
restoring the life of the child, the idea of concealment
will more naturally arise.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>A very remarkable case, in illustration of the subject
under discussion, is related by <i>Burnett</i>, in his
<cite>Treatise on the Criminal Law of Scotland</cite>. “It occurred
at Aberdeen in September 1804. The girl had become
pregnant in circumstances peculiarly disastrous;
actuated by the strongest impulse of shame and remorse,
she concealed her situation from every one,
and ascribed her appearance to cold she had caught.
On the day of her delivery she had been to market,
and in returning home accidentally slipt her foot, and
fell into a mill-pond, where she would have been
drowned had she not obtained immediate assistance.
She was carried all wet into an adjoining malt-kiln,
where there was a large fire, and left under the
charge of another woman. The latter having gone
out for a very short time, leaving the girl sitting by
the fire, found on her return that she had been delivered
of a child. The infant was in life, and lying at
the extremity of the ashes near the fire. The girl
said that her pains came on unexpectedly while sitting
by the fire, and that she became insensible and
could give no assistance to her child. No violence
appeared on the body of the child, but it appeared to
have been scorched by the fire, which occasioned its
death a few hours thereafter. The prosecutor consented
to a petition for banishment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next circumstance which deserves notice under
the consideration of the causes of death, by <em>omission</em>,
is that of <em>neglecting to divide the navel-string, and to
apply a ligature to the infantine portion of it</em>.—With regard
to the value of the presumptive proof of criminal
intention which such neglect may offer, there are
several very weighty objections, and which have been
enumerated by <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i>, in the following order.
1. The infant may perish during its birth from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>hemorrhage from the placenta, or rupture of the navel
string, and the mother may, or may not, have divided
the latter. 2. The child may have lived after
its birth, and the mother may have torn or cut asunder
the navel-string, and finding no hemorrhage ensue
she has not been led to put a ligature on the infantine
portion, and afterwards hemorrhage has taken
place from it, from which the infant has died. 3. The
mother may discover the hemorrhage in the last mentioned
case, and may apply a ligature to the navel
string, but too late to preserve the infant’s life. 4.
The blood of the mother may be artfully placed about
the child, and the navel string left untied; and the
mother may wish to have it appear that the infant perished
from hemorrhage occurring unknown to her,
and that she was not aware of the necessity of tying
the navel-string, even though it be found that she
had <em>cut</em> it, not <em>torn it asunder</em> with her hands. In the
first three cases we shall find, on dissection, evidence
of extensive hemorrhage, as indicated by the emptiness
of the heart and blood-vessels, paleness of the
viscera, &amp;c. In the last case, the proper fulness of
the arterial and venous systems will betray the imposture.
It is impossible, as <i>Dr. Hutchinson</i> very candidly
admits, to trace any rules of general application
respecting the first three cases. The decision must
be partially founded on various collateral moral circumstances,
which come especially within the province
of the jury.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>A new-born child may perish from exposure to cold.</i>
This cause of death will be indicated by the character
of the place and circumstances under which its body
was found. The appearance of the corpse, upon
such an occasion, will also assist our judgment;
there will generally be a paleness of the skin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>a vacuity in the superficial vessels. <i>It may perish
for want of nourishment.</i> But let it be remembered
that new-born children are seldom, or never,
famished to death, within a few days of their birth;
for they require very little nourishment, and it was
formerly the custom to keep them some days from the
breast; such an omission, however, if suspected, may
be ascertained by examining the stomach, and, at the
same time, by deducing from the appearance of the
umbilicus,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> the probable period that has elapsed
since its birth.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Death by commission.</i>—We have already pointed
out the various means by which the death of the newly-born
infant is usually accomplished; such as by
wounding, suffocating, strangling, poisoning, &amp;c.;
and in the course of our work we have so fully considered
the phenomena of violent death, that it cannot
be necessary, on the present occasion, to expend
farther time on their discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last object of the inquiry, viz. <em>the appearance
and condition of the woman’s person</em>, has been also
considered under the history of <i>parturition</i>, and the
various questions to which it has given origin, <i>vol.</i> i,
<i>p.</i> 249.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have thus then presented to the reader the various
avenues of information, which the sciences of anatomy
and physiology are capable of disclosing; and it
will, we trust, appear evident, that the forensic physician
can rarely furnish more than presumptive evidence
in the support of cases of imputed child-murder.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the moral circumstances of the case the medical-jurist
can have nothing to do; and yet it is impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>not to inquire whether the deed may not frequently
be the result of insanity. Such was the opinion
of <i>Dr. Hunter</i>; and we cordially agree with
<i>Dr. Smith</i>, that a verdict to this effect might be returned
in many cases of this kind with at least as
much truth, as in some of suicide. It must not be
urged, continues the last mentioned author, that the
insanity here is not real because temporary, as long
as <em>temporary insanity</em> is so readily admitted in the
other case; and we know well that in many instances
of the like state of mind, where suicide is unsuccessfully
attempted, the supposed lunacy shortly disappears.
This plea, however, rarely avails the child-murderer;
and yet if the loss of property, or other
misfortunes, are to be taken into account as presumptive
causes of insanity where there is real evidence
of the fact, (the <em>feelings</em> arising from which being
the real goad that stings some men to their fate) are
we to give a modest female,—one that has probably
erred through excess of confidence and attachment—no
credit for despair, and distraction, under the
anticipation of the infamy that is approaching her?<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated by several authors, that the period at
which puerperal mania and phrenitis supervenes is
variable, but that it is seldom, if ever, sooner than
the third day; often, not for a fortnight; and, in
some cases, not for several weeks after delivery. We
must be cautious, however, in not applying this general
assertion, to the disparagement of particular
cases; for several instances are recorded which furnish
striking exceptions to the rule. “In the year
1668 at <i>Aylesbury</i>, a married woman of good reputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>being delivered of a child, and not having
slept many nights, fell into a temporary phrenzy, and
killed her infant in the absence of any company; but,
company coming in, she told them she had killed her
infant, and <em>there</em> it lay; she was brought to gaol presently,
and after some sleep she recovered her understanding,
but marvelled how or why she came thither;
she was indicted for murder, and upon her trial the
whole matter appearing, it was left to the jury with
this direction, that if it did appear that she had any
use of reason when she did it, they were to find her
guilty; but if they found her under a phrenzy, though
by reason of her late delivery and want of sleep, they
should acquit her; that had there been any occasion
to move her to this fact, as to hide her shame, which
is ordinarily the case of such as are delivered of bastard
children and destroy them; or if there had been
jealousy of the husband that the child had been none
of his; or if she had hid the infant, or denied the
fact, these had been evidences that the phrenzy was
counterfeit; but none of these appearing, and the
honesty and virtuous deportment of the woman in her
health being known to the jury, and many circumstances
of insanity appearing, the jury found her not
guilty, to the satisfaction of all that heard it.” <i>1 H.
P. C.</i> <i>p.</i> 36. Had this woman been of doubtful character,
though innocent, she might have been executed,
for want of medical evidence to prove the nature
and frequency of puerperal insanity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h2 id='c17' class='c008'>OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND PLEAS IN BAR OF EXECUTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the preceding pages we have endeavoured to
lay down such rules, and to draw attention to such
points, as may enable medical witnesses to assist the
ends of Justice in detecting the perpetration of
crime; another duty remains: having discovered the
guilty, questions may yet arise, as to whether the criminal
is or is not a proper subject for the severity of
the law; 1st, in respect of natural incapacity, as in the
case of infants and idiots <i>a nativitate</i>; 2d, of accidental
incapacities, as in lunacy and temporary derangement
of intellect. So also it may be a medical question
whether a prisoner stands mute of malice, or by the
visitation of God; and 3dly, of temporary unfitness for
punishment, as where judgment on a female is to be
respited, by reason of her pregnancy; to these we
shall add the plea of non-identity, for though we
have already stated that personal identity does not
appear to us to be a subject peculiarly appropriate to
medical jurisprudence,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> yet as the greater number
of writers on this subject have so considered it, we
should not be warranted in omiting all notice of the
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is clear that an infant above fourteen and under
twenty-one is equally subject to capital punishments,
as well as others of full age; for it is <i>præsumptio juris</i>,
that after fourteen years they are <i>doli capaces</i>,
and can discern between good and evil; and if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>law should not animadvert upon such offenders by
reason of their nonage, the kingdom would come to
confusion.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Experience makes us know, that every
day murders,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> bloodsheds, burglaries, larcenies,
burning of houses,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a> rapes,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a> clipping and counterfeiting
of money, are committed by youths above
fourteen and under twenty-one; and if they should
have impunity by reason of such their minority, no
man’s life or estate would be safe. In my remembrance,
at <i>Thetford</i>, a young lad of sixteen years old
was convict for successive wilful burning of three
dwelling houses, and in the last of them burning a
child to death, and yet had carried the matter so
subtilly, that by a false accusation of another person
for burning the first house, an innocent person
was brought in danger, if it had not been strangely
discovered: he had judgment to die, and was executed
accordingly.” <i>1 Hale. P. C.</i> <i>p.</i> 25.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>But though above fourteen, criminal incapacity cannot
be presumed on the mere pretence of nonage,
children considerably under that age may be found
<i>doli capaces</i>, and be tried, and even executed accordingly,
whenever from peculiar evidence it shall appear
that by precocity in vice or intellect they can
clearly distinguish right from wrong, <i>malitia supplet
ætatem</i>: thus <i>John Dean</i> was executed under the age
of nine for arson and murder; and <i>William York</i>, in
more modern times, was tried and condemned for
murder at ten.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a> Seven years of age, or the period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of absolute infancy, is probably the limit within
which actual crime or sin cannot be imputed morally
or legally; (see <i>1 H. P. C.</i> <i>p.</i> 19; <i>1 Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>p.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>1; <i>1 Bl. Com.</i> <i>p.</i> 464); but the law of England does
not appear to have fixed any determinate period;<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
<i>Alfred</i> decreed that none should be punished capitally
for theft under twelve years of age. <i>Athelstan</i>
enlarged the period till fifteen, (see <i>notes 1 H. P. C.</i>
<i>p.</i> 12, 23); but the old standard of twelve appears to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>have prevailed from the time of <i>Hen. 1</i>; thus in the
time of <i>Ed. 1</i>, <i>Adam de Arnhale</i>, æt. 12, was committed
to the custody of the marshal for stealing nine
shillings at night in the dwelling house; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">postea habito
respecto ad imprisonamentum, quod prædictus
Adam habuit, &amp; etiam ad teneram ætatem ejusdem
Adæ, eo quod non nisi ætatis 12 annorum, qui talis
ætatis judicium ferre non potest, ideo</span></i> de gratia <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">regis
deliberetur</span></i>, <i>1 P. C.</i> 24; but he was spared, as <i>Sir
M. Hale</i> says, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de gratia regis</span></i>, in respect that he was
passed the old standard of twelve years.</p>

<p class='c000'>If an infant clearly under seven years of age be indicted,
the case ought not to go to the jury; but the
prisoner should be discharged by the court; for “he
cannot be guilty of felony, whatever circumstances of
discretion may appear; for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex presumptione juris</span></i> he
cannot have discretion, and no averment shall be received
against that presumption;” (<i>1 H. P. C.</i> p. 28)
but if it be not apparent that he is under seven, and
he have sufficient discretion, then, as in the case mentioned
[<i>note</i> <a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a>] the issue may go to the jury; and with
their verdict they may find, according to the evidence,
that he was under seven years of age; and the
court may then discharge him, for it was no felony.
<i>1 H. P. C.</i> 27. Also if the prisoner be above seven,
and under twelve years of age, unless there be apparent
proof of capacity; but it is safer for the court to
discharge him, for his trial can answer no useful purpose;
and if he once be a felon convict by the verdict
of a jury, though subsequently pardoned, the
circumstance will probably give a stamp to his character
which is never likely to be effaced. Therefore
if the humanity of magistrates and prosecutors
does not previously interpose to save children from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>this peril, and the contamination of a gaol, the discretion
of the judge may; and it is fortunate that, in
London at least, public munificence, in this as in
many other cases, has supplied the want of legislation:
the Philanthropic and other similar societies
afford a refuge and prospect of amendment for the infant
culprit, to them therefore he should be committed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the fact of absolute infancy may generally be ascertained
by the mere view of the party, and his capacity
ascertained by questions propounded by the
court, an infant prisoner may, as before stated, be
discharged without further trial; not so however in
cases of idiotcy, madness, or lunacy, these must be
tried by a jury, for they may easily be feigned, and
it is therefore by evidence of previous conduct that
the question is to be determined, rather than by reference
to the prisoner’s demeanor in court, which
may probably be counterfeit.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the prisoner be found to be an idiot, he must be
discharged of the indictment, and handed over to
safe custody,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a> but if he be only lunatic, then other
questions arise; first, whether the prisoner is then
in a lucid interval, for if he be not, he should not be
arraigned at that time; “but the judge in his discretion
may discharge the jury of him, and remit him to
gaol to be tried after the recovery of his understanding,
especially if any doubt appear upon the evidence
touching the guilt of the <em>fact</em>, and this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in favorem
vitæ</span></i>; and if there be no colour of evidence to prove
him guilty, or if there be a pregnant evidence to
prove his insanity at the time of the fact committed,
then upon the same favor of life and liberty it is fit it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>should be proceeded in the trial in order to his acquittal
and enlargement.” <i>1 H. P. C.</i> 35.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, if he be then in a lucid interval, and
therefore fit to be tried, whether he was so at the
time of the act committed, and this must be tried according
to the whole evidence both of the fact and
the lunacy, on a plea of not guilty.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For criminal purposes it is not sufficient that a prisoner
have been previously found idiot or lunatic, or
the contrary, by inquisition in chancery, <i>1 H. P. C.</i>
<i>p.</i> 33, though the circumstance may create a strong
presumption. For there may be a partial insanity
which may disqualify a man from the management of
his estate, and therefore render him a fit subject for
the equitable protection, although he may have a
perfect sense of right and wrong in criminal matters,
and ought therefore to be responsible for his acts.
Personal antipathies and fancied injury are constant
subjects of limited insanity; but these ought not to
excuse murder; for such a doctrine, by removing the
restraints of fear, would constantly convert the passions
of hatred and revenge, in themselves limited
madness, into absolute insanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He that is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos mentis</span></i> and <em>totally</em> deprived
of all compassings and imaginations, cannot commit
high treason by compassing or imagining the death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>of the king; for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">furiosus solo furore punitur</span></i>; but it
must be an <em>absolute</em> madness, and a total deprivation
of memory.” <i>Coke</i>, <i>P. C.</i> <i>p.</i> 3; but in <i>Beverly’s</i> case,
<i>4 Rep.</i> 124, he says “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mes in ascun cases non compos
mentis poit committe haut treason, comme si il tua, ou
offer a tuer le roy</span></i>.” “This,” says <i>Sir Mathew Hale</i>,
“is a safe exception, and I shall not question it, because
it tends so much to the safety of the king’s person:
but yet the same author (<i>Coke</i> <i>P. C.</i> <i>p.</i> 6) tells
us, that though this was anciently thought to be law,
yet it is not so now; for such a person as cannot
compass the death of the king by reason of his insanity,
cannot be guilty of treason within the statute
of <i>25 Ed.</i> 3.” Nothing can be more honourable to
the independent impartiality of the English law than
such an interpretation, amply illustrated in the cases
of <i>Hatfield</i> (<i>27 How. St. Tri.</i>) and others, who had attempted
the life of his late Majesty <i>George</i> the 3d;
and this more especially, as the king must at all
times be more exposed to this species of attack than
any other person; for beside the sense of supposed
wrong, delay or perversion of justice, exaggerated
political feeling,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a> or other causes all pointing the
maniac to the same object, there is no madness more
frequent than fancied greatness; lunatic asylums
are filled with imaginary emperors, kings, princes,
and nobles, whose only glimmering of reason is to
direct their vengeance against the supposed usurpers
of their dignities.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He who is guilty of any crime whatever through
his voluntary drunkenness shall be punished for it as
much as if he had been sober.” <i>1 Hawk. P. C.</i> 3.
“A drunkard,” says <i>Sir E. Coke</i>, (<i>1 Ins.</i> 247) “who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>is <i>voluntarius dæmon</i>, hath no privilege thereby.”
<i>4 Bl. Com.</i> 26. But if by continual drunkenness he
have become absolutely mad, then the original cause
is not referred to, and he may be excused; not so
however if there be only a predisposition to temporary
madness, and that madness be voluntarily excited
by drinking. There are many men, soldiers, who
have been severely wounded, in the head especially,
who well know that excess makes them mad; but if
such persons wilfully deprive themselves of reason,
they ought not to be excused one crime by the voluntary
perpetration of another.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“He who incites a madman (idiot, infant, or lunatic)
to do a murder or other crime, (as to kill himself)
is a principal offender, and as much punishable
as if he had done it himself.” <i>1 Hawk. P. C.</i> <i>p.</i> 3
<i>and</i> 118. <i>1 H. P. C.</i> 617.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems agreed at this day, that if one, who has
committed a capital offence, become <i>non compos</i> before
conviction, he shall not be arraigned; and if
after conviction, that he shall not be executed.” <i>1
Hawk. P. C.</i> 3; <i>1 H. P. C.</i> 36. Indeed in the
bloody reign of <i>Henry</i> the eighth, a statute was made
(<i>33 H. 8</i>, <i>c.</i> 20) which enacted, that if a person,
being <i>compos mentis</i>, should commit treason, and
after fall into madness, he might be tried in his absence,
and should suffer death, as if he were of perfect
memory. But this savage and inhuman law was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>repealed by the <i>Stat. 1 and 2 P. and M.</i> <i>c.</i> 10. For
as is observed by <i>Sir Ed. Coke</i>, “the execution of an
offender is for example, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut pœna ad paucos, metus
ad omnes perveniat</span></i>: but so it is not when a madman
is executed; but should be a miserable spectacle,
both against law, and of extreme inhumanity
and cruelty, and can be no example to others.”
<i>4 Bl. Com.</i> <i>p.</i> 25.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pregnancy is a good plea in bar of execution; but
it does not prevent trial or sentence; in a recent instance,
however, when a woman was brought to the
bar evidently in labour, she was remanded by the
court; and query, whether this discretion ought not
to be exercised in all cases of advanced pregnancy;
for the agitation of the trial may be of more fatal
effect than the judgment of the law, and the unfortunate
woman, though acquitted, may perish with her
child from the mere effect of mental distraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the plea of pregnancy is made to stay execution
“the judge must direct a jury of twelve matrons
or discreet women to inquire the fact: and if they
bring in their verdict <em>quick with child</em> (for barely <em>with
child</em><a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a> unless it be alive in the womb, is not sufficient)
execution shall be stayed generally till the next
session: and so from session to session till either she
is delivered, or proves by the course of nature not to
have been with child at all. But if she once hath the
benefit of this reprieve, and has been delivered, and
afterwards become pregnant again, she shall not be
entitled to the benefit of a further respite from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>cause.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a> For she may now be executed before the
child is <em>quick</em> in the womb; and shall not, by her
own incontinence, evade the sentence of justice.” <i>4
Bl. Com.</i> 395; (see also <i>2 Hawk. P. C.</i> 658, and authorities
there.) But <i>Sir M. Hale</i> says that though
she be <em>quick</em> a second time she shall have no respite
on that account. <i>1 P. C.</i> 369. And yet he afterwards
draws a nice distinction <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in favorem prolis</span></i>, that if the
woman were not quick, or with child at all,<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a> at the
time of the first inquest of the matrons, and afterwards
become with child, she shall have her respite;
“for the advantage she had at first was not really by
reason of pregnancy, but by a mistake of the jury of
women.” “And therefore as hath been said, in all
cases of reprieves for pregnancy, the judge ought to
make a new demand, what the prisoner hath to say
wherefore execution should not be awarded.” <i>Ib.</i>
And so in all cases where any time intervenes between
the attainder and the award of execution, for the
party may have become insane, or may plead pregnancy,
or a pardon, or an act of grace, or diversity
of person, that he is not the same that was attainted.
<i>1 Bl. Com.</i> 396.</p>

<p class='c000'>This brings us to the last of the pleas which we have
proposed to treat upon under this head. The question
of Personal Identity may arise in many ways; as
whether a child claiming an inheritance is the same
that he pretends, or is pretended to be, as in the <i>Douglas</i>
or <i>Anglesea</i> causes; (vide ante) whether a prisoner
is actually the person who committed a particular offence,
when the jury tries the fact and the identity together;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and where a prisoner after conviction escapes
and is retaken, whether he is the same that was convicted.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a>
The former cases we have noticed under
the heads of Supposititious Children, vol. i, p. 220,
warning our readers not to be too hasty in determining
identity upon mere resemblance.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> And in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>last case “a jury shall be impanneled to try the collateral
issue, namely, the identity of his person; and
not whether guilty or innocent; for that has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>decided before. And in these collateral issues the
trial shall be <i>instanter</i>, and no time allowed the prisoner
to make his defence or produce his witnesses,
unless he will make oath that he is not the person attainted:
(<i>Fors. C. L.</i> 41) neither shall any peremptory
challenges of the jury be allowed the prisoner;
though formerly such challenges were held to be allowable,
whenever a man’s life was in question.” <i>4
Bl. Com.</i> 396. And query whether this is not the better
doctrine; the case of <i>Mr. Radcliffe</i>, brother of
<i>Lord Derwentwater</i>, (<i>Fors. C. L.</i> 41) in which the
contrary was held, was for high treason shortly after
the rebellion of 1745; and as <i>Sir M. Forster</i> says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>speaking of <i>Monmouth’s</i> attainder, “that was a time
of great heat and violence, and few things then done
ought to be drawn into example.” <i>Ib.</i> 44. There
does not appear to be any good reason why a prisoner
should not have all the safeguards on a collateral
issue or inquest of office, which are allowed on the
main issue; especially when, as in the present instance,
his life depends upon the question.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>
  <h2 id='c18' class='c008'>OF PUNISHMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Punishments may be divided into three classes;
capital, when the death of the offender is intended to
deter others from similar offence; precautionary,
when a noxious individual is removed from general
society by imprisonment or transportation; and correctional,
when by some pain or penalty inflicted on
the individual, he is to be deterred from future crime.
Though the subject would admit of much curious
detail, our remaining space will not allow us to trace
the different modes or modifications of legitimate
punishment used in various nations or ages; nor to
enter our protest of abhorrence against the many and
inhuman tortures which religious fanaticism or political
rancour have invented for their antagonists; the
only point on which we can physiologically have occasion
to observe, as applicable to the capital punishments
of the present times, is, that they should be
inflicted with as little pain as possible to the criminal,
lest compassion for the sufferings of the man, should
supersede the salutary horror of his offence; an end
which is really, though not apparently, attained in
our ordinary mode of execution by hanging; the
victim does not suffer, though sometimes his convulsive
struggles induce a contrary belief; but the method
is defective in one point, it is not calculated to
produce a deep impression on the minds of spectators,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompa mortis magis terret quam mors ipsa</span></i>. The
French mode of decapitation, though held in abhorrence
from the outrages with which its very name has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>become associated, is equally humane; an instant
terminates the mortal sufferings of the criminal; for
this reason it was originally adopted, and when we
consider that it superceded the barbarous punishment
of breaking on the wheel, previously in use, and the
clumsy and uncertain method of decapitation by the
sword or axe, we feel ourselves justified, in spite of
popular prejudice, in designating the guillotine<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> an
invention of humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Decapitation is also a punishment known in the law
of England, and as a more dignified and impressive
death, is reserved for the execution of nobles, or distinguished
commoners, in cases of high treason, the
rest of the barbarous sentence (now abolished by act
of parliament), and the previous sentence of hanging,
being dispensed with by the king’s authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The barbarous punishment of burning, formerly
part of the law, is no longer in use; Catharine Hayes,
to whose case we have alluded (vol. ii, p. 73), was
the last who suffered in this manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the subject of imprisonment we have already
commented, (vol. ii, p. 112), and from the very general
attention now excited, as well by the discovery
of abuses, as by an encreasing spirit of humanity, we
may expect the best results.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of punishment, not capital, there are two which
require medical consideration; the one is military
flogging, the other the novel invention of the tread-mill.
On the first of these, we might have had more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>cause to complain, had the old system of the army
been continued; it is however due to the character
of the present Commander in Chief to notice, that
under his direction the punishment of flogging has
been much diminished; regimental courts martial,
composed of five officers (possibly <em>infants</em>), are now
restricted in their sentences to the infliction of three
hundred lashes; formerly double the number was
deemed a moderate punishment; and there is good
reason to believe, that the discipline of a regiment,
and the capacity of a commanding officer, is no longer
considered in the direct, but on the contrary, in the
inverse ratio of the number of lashes inflicted:<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a> we
need not say that the general state and conduct of
troops has proved the policy of the alteration, we have
only to hope that the improvement will be extended,
and that the English army will not long be subjected
to a degrading and barbarous torture, from which less
moral men, and much worse soldiers, are exempted in
every other service in Europe. It is necessary, however,
that till this very desirable reform is effected,
some observation should be made on the mode of inflicting
this punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is generally supposed that the surgeon who is
present at a military execution, is responsible for its
consequences; this is not legally true, and it is physiologically
impossible; the punishment is too uncertain
in its operation to allow of any medical assistant’s
ascertaining the boundaries of danger; moral feeling,
age, strength, nervous irritability, climate, previous
disease, organic defects, and other circumstances,
many of which it would be impossible for the most
skilful to detect, and least of all by mere view of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>culprit tied up to the halberts, may render a punishment
fatal, which had been intended to be lenient.
No surgeon therefore can answer, either for the ultimate,
or immediate consequences of this species of
corporal punishment; he may indeed err on the safe
side, by interposing as early as possible,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> but there
is no criterion by which he can be guided in forming
an absolute opinion on the danger or safety of the punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though the surgeon cannot be held criminally
responsible (except in cases of gross ignorance or
negligence) for the result of such executions, yet, if
the commanding officer permits a single lash to be
inflicted after the medical attendant has interposed,
he would be held guilty of murder should the soldier
die from the effects of excessive punishment; for malice
will be presumed from such continuance after due
notice.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a> In the notorious case of Governor <i>Wall</i>,
who was executed for the murder of a soldier by excessive
and illegal flogging; the punishment was originally
unlawful, having been inflicted without sentence
of a court martial, the mode of infliction was
unusual, and the surgeon was stated to have been
so much intimidated, that he was afraid to interfere,
(a poor excuse for neglect of professional duty); under
these circumstances, the plea that the deceased killed
himself by excessive drinking, though the fact was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>far from improbable under the climate of <i>Goree</i>, was
unavailable; the illegal flogging was the primary
cause of the death, and therefore neither the effect of
climate, misconduct, or mismanagement, could remove
the original criminality. In this as in several other
cases of death from ill-usage, it is a constant but unavailing
plea that the deceased died not of the wounds
or blows, but of fever, or defective treatment.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the subject of the tread-mill, we are not enabled
to pronounce any very decided opinion, the invention
has not been in use long enough to determine with
any degree of accuracy its merits or defects; that it
is held in considerable dread by offenders is certain,
and the fear of returning to it may operate favourably
on that class for which it appears best calculated, the
regular vagabond; but it does not give any habit of
industry, or teach any mode of labour to the merely
idle or casually culpable, and therefore ought not to
be indiscriminately applied to all cases. The punishment
too is one of the most unequal in its operation
that can be conceived; a man, who has been accustomed
to running up stairs all his life, with good
lungs and muscular legs, will scarcely suffer by it;
while an asthmatic tailor, weaver, or other sedentary
artizan will be half killed by the exercise. For
women in certain stages, whether of menstruation or
pregnancy, it is a dangerous and indecent torture,
one which should immediately be forbidden, if not by
the humanity of magistrates, by the wisdom of the
legislature.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>One very material objection to this machine arises
out of the probability of abuse in the places where it
is generally erected; an air of mystery has been
thrown round houses of correction, which has acquired
for some of them the odious name of bastile;
even grand juries have been denied admission to
them, on the ground that they are the prisons of the
magistrates, not of the sheriff; we certainly do not
understand either the policy or propriety of this distinction;
that they should not be thrown open to the
idle or merely curious we are ready to admit, but
contend that they should be open to all official inspection;
much must in every prison depend on the conduct
and discretion of the jailors—to know that he is
open to public animadversion is the best security for
the due exercise of his office: a contrary assurance is
well calculated to produce despotic feeling in ordinary
minds; how much more then is it to be guarded
against, when persons of the lower class are entrusted
with extraordinary power of coercion, and are continually
irritated by the refractory conduct of those
who are placed under their authority. In such cases
constant inspection, at uncertain times, and by <em>uninterested</em>
persons, is the best guarantee against abuse.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>While this work was in the press several circumstances
have occurred which it may be necessary to
notice; first, as respecting the corporate medical bodies,
His Majesty has been pleased to confer additional
honors on the President of the College of Physicians,
for which see the Preface;—the College itself
is about to be removed from their late house in Warwick
Lane to a more convenient site among the new
buildings of Pall Mall East. A new charter has been
granted to the College of Surgeons, but as it is not
yet confirmed by Act of Parliament, it does not materially
vary the public right of the College, or supply
what was wanting in their jurisdiction. The Apothecaries’
Company have very properly exerted their
powers under the Act of <i>55 Geo.</i> iii, for punishing
illegal practice.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Marriage Act which is incidentally referred
to, vol. i, p. 169, is in part repealed by an act of
the last session, which in turn is about to be amended
or repealed in the present. The <i>Portsmouth case</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">adhuc
sub judice</span></i>, affords some curious illustrations on
the subjects of impotence and insanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The impolitic duty on salt has been lowered to
one-seventh of its former amount. An act has been
passed to prevent nuisances by gas-water; (<i>vol.</i>
i, <i>p.</i> 339) and another for regulating the sale of
Bread; (<i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 375) to these we must refer our
readers for the modification or correction of our
former remarks on the several subjects connected
with them.</p>

within this Realm excercised by a great multitude of ignorant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_4'>a_4</span>Persons, of whom the great part have no manner of Insight
in the same, nor in any other Kind of Learning; some also
can no Letters on the Book, so far forth, that common
Artificers, as Smiths, Weavers, and Women boldly and
accustomably take upon them great Cures, and Things of
great Difficulty, in the which they partly use Sorcery and
Witchcraft, partly apply such Medicines unto the Disease
as be very noious, and nothing meet therefore, to the high
Displeasure of God, great Infamy to the Faculty, and the
grievous Hurt, Damage, and Destruction of many of the
King’s liege People, most especially of them that cannot
discern the uncunning from the cunning:’ Be it therefore
(to the Security and Comfort of all manner People) by the
Authority of this present Parliament enacted, That no
Person within the City of <i>London</i>, nor within Seven Miles
of the same, take upon him to exercise and occupy as a
Physician or Surgeon, except he be first examined, approved,
and admitted by the Bishop of <i>London</i>, or by the Dean of
<i>Paul’s</i>, for the time being, calling to him or them Four
Doctors of Physick, and for Surgery other expert Persons
in that Faculty, and for the first Examination such as they
shall think convenient, and afterward alway Four of them
that have been so appointed, upon the Pain of Forfeiture for
every Month that they do occupy as Physicians or Surgeons,
not admitted nor examined after the Tenour of this Act, of
<i>v. li.</i> to be imployed the one Half thereof to the Use of our
Sovereign Lord the King, and the other Half to any Person
that will sue for it by Action of Debt, in which no Wager
of Law nor Protection shall be allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>II. And over this, That no Person out of the said City,
and Precinct of Seven Miles of the same, except he have
been (as is aforesaid) approved in the same, take upon him
to exercise and occupy as a Physician or Surgeon, in any
Diocese within this Realm, but if he be first examined and
approved by the Bishop of the same Diocese, or, he being
out of the Diocese, by his Vicar General; either of them
calling to them such expert Persons in the said Faculties, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_5'>a_5</span>their discretion shall think convenient, and giving their
Letters Testimonials under their Seal to him that they shall
so approve, upon like pain to them that occupy the contrary
to this Act (as is above said) to be levied and imployed
after the Form before expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>III. Provided alway, That this Act, nor any thing
therein contained, be prejudicial to the Universities of <i>Oxford</i>

the contrary, as well in this noble City of <i>London</i>, as in all
other Cities and Boroughs within this Realm or elsewhere,
for the continual Service and Attendance that they daily
and nightly, at all Hours and Times, give to the King’s
liege People, for the Relief of the same, according to their
Science, have been exempt and discharged from all Offices
and Business wherein they should use or bear any manner of
Armour or Weapon, and with like Privilege have been intreated
as Heralds of Arms, as well in Battles and Fields,
as other places, therefore to stand unharnessed and unweaponed,
according to the Law of Arms, because they be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_6'>a_6</span>Persons that never used Feats of War nor ought to use,
but only the Business and Exercise of their Science, to the
Help and Comfort of the King’s liege People in the time
of their Need: And in the aforesaid City of <i>London</i>, from
the time of their first Incorporation, when they have been
many more in number than they now be, were never called
nor charged to be on Quest, Watch, nor other Office, whereby
they should use or occupy any Armour or defenceable
Geer of War, where through they should be unready, and

of the Craft and Mystery of Surgeons, in regard of the
great Multitude of Patients that be, and daily chance, and
infortune happeneth and increaseth in the foresaid City of

wounded and hurt, for Default of Help in Time to them to
be shewed, perish, and so divers have done, as evidently is
known, by occasion that your said Suppliants have been
compelled to attend upon such Constableship, Watches and
Juries, as is aforesaid; be it enacted and established by the
King our Sovereign Lord, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and by the Commons, in the present Parliament
assembled, and by Authority of the same, That from
henceforth your said Suppliants be discharged, and not
chargeable of Constableship, Watch, and of all manner of
Office bearing any Armour, and also of all Inquests and
Juries within the City of <i>London</i>: And also that this Act in
all things do extend to all Barber Surgeons admitted and
approved to exercise the said Mystery of Surgeons, according
to the Form of the Statute lately made in that Behalf,
so that they exceed not, nor be at one time above the number
of Twelve Persons.</p>

Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons, in this

this Realm, that it is very expedient and needful to provide
for Men expert in the Science of Physick and
Surgery, for the Health of Man’s Body, when Infirmities
and Sickness shall happen, for the due Exercise and
Maintenance whereof good and necessary Acts be already
made and provided; yet nevertheless, forasmuch as within
the City of <i>London</i>, where Men of great Experience, as
well in Speculation as in Practice of the Science and
Faculty of Surgery, be abiding and inhabiting, and have
more commonly the daily Exercise and Experience of the
same Science of Surgery, than is had or used within other
Parts of this Realm; and by occasion thereof many expert
Persons be brought up under them as their Servants,
Apprentices and others, who by the Exercise and diligent
Information of their said Masters, as well now as hereafter,
shall exercise the said Science within divers other parts of
this Realm, to the great Relief, Comfort and Succour of
much People, and to the sure Safeguard of their bodily
Health, their Limbs and Lives; and forasmuch as within
the said City of <i>London</i>, there be now two several and
distinct Companies of Surgeons, occupying and exercising
the said Science and Faculty of Surgery, the one Company
being called <i>The Barbers of London</i>, and the other
Company called <i>The Surgeons of London</i>, which Company
of Barbers be incorporated to sue and be sued by the

of the Letters Patents under the Great Seal of the late
King of famous Memory, King <i>Edward</i> the Fourth, dated

the first year of his Reign, which afterward, as well by
our now most dread Sovereign Lord, as by the right noble

may appear; and the other Company called the Surgeons,
be not incorporate, nor have any manner of Corporation;
which two several and distinct Companies of Surgeons
were necessary to be united, and made one Body incorporate,
to the intent that by their Union and often
assembly together, the good and due Order, Exercise, and
Knowlege of the said Science or Faculty of Surgery should
be as well in Speculation as in Practice, both to themselves,
and all other their said Servants and Apprentices,
now and hereafter to be brought up under them, and by
their Learnings and diligent and ripe Informations, more
perfect, speedy and effectual Remedy should be, than it
hath been, or should be if the said two Companies of
Barbers and Surgeons should continue severed asunder,
and not joined together, as they before this time have
been, and used themselves not medling together;’ wherefore
in consideration of the Premisses, be it enacted by the
King our Sovereign Lord, and by the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and by the Commons in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said
two several and distinct Companies of Surgeons, that is to
say, both the Barbers and the Surgeons and every Person of
them, being a Freeman of either of the said Companies after
the Custom of the said City of <i>London</i>, and their Successors
from henceforth, immediately be united and made one
entire and whole body corporate and one Commonalty

of the said Mystery and Commonalty of Barbers of <i>London</i>;
and also shall peaceably and quietly have and enjoy all and
singular Benefices, Grants, Liberties, Privileges, Franchises
and free Customs, and also all manner of other Things at
any time given or granted unto the said Companies of
Barbers or Surgeons by whatsoever name or names they
or any of them were called, and which they or any of
them now have, or any of their Predecessors have had,
by Act of Parliament, Letters Patents, of the King’s
Highness, or other his most noble Progenitors, or otherwise
by any lawful means have had at any time afore this present
Act, in as large and ample Manner and Form as they or any
of them have, had, might or should enjoy the same, this
Union or Conjunction of the said Companies together
notwithstanding; and as largely to have and enjoy the
Premisses, as if the same were and had been specially and
particularly expressed and declared with the best and most
clearest Words and Terms in the Law, to all Intents and
Purposes, and that all persons of the said Company now
incorporate by this present Act, and their Successors, shall
be lawfully admitted and approved to occupy Surgery, after
the form of the Statute in that case ordained and provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_20'>a_20</span>shall be exempt from bearing of Armor, or to be put in any
Watches or Inquests; and that they and their Successors
shall have the Search, Oversight, Punishment, and Correction,
as well of Freemen as of Foreigners for such Offences
as they or any of them shall commit or do against the good
Order of Barbery or Surgery, as afore this Time among the
said Mystery and Company of Barbers of <i>London</i> hath been
used and accustomed, according to the good and politick
Rules and Ordinances by them made, and approved by the
Lord Chancellor, Treasurer and two chief Justices of either
Bench, or any three of them after the Form of the Statute in
that case ordained and provided.</p>

<p class='c000'>II. And further be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid,
That the said Masters or Governors of the Mystery and
Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons of <i>London</i> and their
Successors yearly for ever, after their said Discretions, at
their free Liberty and Pleasure, shall and may have and
take without Contradiction four persons condemned, adjudged,
and put to death for Felony by the due Order of
the King’s Laws of this Realm for Anatomies, without any
further Suit or Labour to be made to the King’s Highness,
his Heirs or Successors of the same; and to make Incision
of the same dead bodies, or otherwise to order the same
after their said Discretions at their Pleasures for their further
and better Knowledge, Instruction, Insight, Learning and
Experience in the said Science or Faculty of Surgery;
saving unto all Persons their Heirs and Successors all such
Right, Title, Interest and demand which they or any of
them might lawfully claim or have in or to any of the Lands
and Tenements with the Appurtenances belonging unto the
said Company of Barbers and Surgeons, or any of them, at
any time afore the making of this Act, in as ample Manner
and Form as they or any of them had or ought to have had
heretofore; any Thing in this present Act comprised to the
contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c000'>III. And forasmuch as such Persons using the Mystery
or Faculty of Surgery, oftentimes meddle and take unto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_21'>a_21</span>their Cures and houses such sick and diseased Persons as
been infected with the Pestilence Great Pox, and such
other contagious Infirmities do use or exercise Barbery, as
washing, or shaving or other Feats thereunto belonging
which is very perilous for infecting the King’s liege People
resorting to their Shops and houses there being washed or
shaven: Wherefore it is now inacted, ordained and provided
by the Authority aforesaid, That no manner of Person
within the City of <i>London</i>, Suburbs of the same and one
Mile Compass of the said City of <i>London</i>, after the feast of
the Nativity of our Lord God next coming, using Barbery
or Shaving or that hereafter shall use any Barbery or
Shaving within the said City of <i>London</i>, Suburbs or one
mile Circuit of the same City of <i>London</i>, he nor they nor
none other for them, to his or their Use, shall occupy any
Surgery, letting of blood, or any other thing belonging to
Surgery; drawing of teeth only except. And furthermore
in like manner whosoever that useth the Mystery or Craft
of Surgery within the Circuit aforesaid as long as he shall
fortune to use the said Mystery or Craft of Surgery, shall in
no wise occupy nor exercise the Feat or Craft of Barbery
or Shaving, neither by himself, nor by none other for him, to
his use or their use: And moreover, that all manner of
Persons using Surgery for the time being, as well Freemen
as Foreigners, Aliens and Strangers within the said City
of <i>London</i>, the Suburbs thereof, and one Mile compass of
the said City of London, before the Feast of <i>St. Michael</i>,
the Archangel next coming, shall have an open Sign on the
Street side where they shall fortune to dwell, that all the
King’s liege People there passing by may know at all times,
whither to resort for Remedies in Time of necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>IV. And further be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid,
That no manner of Person after the said Feast of St.
<i>Michael</i> the Archangel next coming, presume to keep any
Shop of Barbery or Shaving within the City of <i>London</i>,
except he be a Freeman of the same Corporation and
Company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_22'>a_22</span>V. And furthermore at such Times heretofore accustomed,
there shall be chosen by the same Company four Masters or
Governors of the same Corporation or Company, of the
which four, two of them shall be expert in Surgery, and the
other two in Barbery; which four Masters, and every of
them, shall have full Power and Authority from Time to
Time, during their said Office, to have the Oversight,
Search, Punishment and Correction of all such Defaults and
Inconveniences as shall be found among the said Company
using Barbery or Surgery, as well of Freemen as Foreigners,
Aliens or Strangers, within the City of <i>London</i> and the
Circuits aforesaid, after their said Discretions; And if any
Person or Persons using any Barbery or Surgery at any
Time hereafter offend in any of these Articles aforesaid,
that then for every Month the said Persons so offending
shall lose, forfeit and pay <i>v. li.</i> the one Moiety thereof to
the King our Sovereign Lord, and the other Moiety to any
Person that will or shall sue therefore by Action of Debt,
Bill, Plaint or Information in any of the King’s Courts,
where no Wager of Law, Essoin or Protection shall be
admitted or allowed in the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>VI. Provided that the said Barbers and Surgeons, and
every of them, shall bear and pay Lot and Scot, and such
other Charges as they and their Predecessors have been
accustomed to pay within the said City of <i>London</i>; this
Act nor any thing therein contained to the contrary hereof
in any wise notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c000'>VII. Provided alway, and be it enacted by Authority
aforesaid, That it shall be lawful to any of the King’s Subjects,
not being Barber or Surgeon, to retain have and keep
in his House as his Servant any Person being a Barber or
Surgeon, which shall and may use and exercise those Arts
and Faculties of Barbery or Surgery, or either of them in
his Master’s House, or elsewhere by his Master’s Licence
or Commandment; any Thing in this Act above written to
the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

same, should take upon him to exercise and occupy as
Physician or Surgeon, except he be first examined, approved
and admitted by the Bishop of London, and others, under
and upon certain Pains and Penalties, in the same Act
mentioned: since the making of which Act, the Company
and Fellowship of Surgeons of <i>London</i>, minding only their
own lucres, and nothing the profit or ease of the Diseased
or Patient, have sued, troubled, and vexed divers honest
Persons, as well Men as Women, whom God hath endued
with the knowledge of the nature, kind and operation of
certain herbs, roots and waters, and the using and ministering
of them to such as been pained with customable
Diseases, as Women’s Breasts being Sore, a Pin and the
Web in the eye, Uncomes of Hands, Burnings, Scaldings,
Sore Mouths, the Stone, Stranguary, Saucelim, and

Persons have not taken any thing for their Pains or
Cunning, but have ministered the same to poor People
only, for Neighbourhood and God’s sake, and of Pity and
Charity; and it is well known, that the Surgeons admitted
will do no cure to any Person, but where they shall know
to be rewarded with a greater sum or reward than the
cure extendeth unto; for in case they would minister their
cunning unto sore People unrewarded, there should not so
many rot, and perish to Death for lack or help of Surgery,

<p class='c012'>‘Whereas the Act of the Apothecary is of great and
general Use and Benefit, by reason of their constant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_28'>a_28</span>necessary Assistance of his Majesty’s Subjects, which
should oblige them solely to attend the Duty of their
Professions; yet by reason that they are compelled to serve
several Parish, Ward, and Leet Offices, in the Places
where they live, and are frequently summoned to serve on
Juries and Inquests, which take up great Part of their
Time, they cannot perform the Trusts reposed in them as
they ought, nor attend the Sick with such Diligence as is
required: And whereas, King <i><span class='sc'>James</span></i> the First, by His

<p class='c012'>‘Whereas in and by certain Letters Patent, under
the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, bearing Date the twenty-fourth
Day of <i>February</i> in the first Year of the Reign of
his then Majesty King Edward the Fourth, after reciting,
That the Freemen of the Mystery of Barbers of the City
of <i>London</i>, using the Mystery or Faculty of Surgery, had
for a long Time, exercised and sustained, and still continued
to exercise and sustain great Application and
Labour, as well about the curing and healing Wounds,
Blows and other Infirmities, as in the letting of Blood,
and drawing of Teeth; and that by the Ignorance and
Unskilfulness of some of the said Barbers, as well Freemen
of the said City as of others, being foreign Surgeons,
many misfortunes had happened to divers People, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_31'>a_31</span>Unskilfulness of such Barbers and Surgeons, in healing
and curing Wounds, Blows, Hurts and other Infirmities;
and that it was to be feared, that the like or worse Evils
might thereafter ensue, unless a suitable Remedy was
speedily provided in the Premisses; his said then Majesty
did therefore, at the Supplication of the Freemen of the
said Mystery of Barbers, in the said City of <i>London</i>, grant
to them, amongst other Things, that the said Mystery,
and all the Men of the said Mystery of the said City,
should be one Body, and one perpetual Community; and
that two Principals of the same Commonalty, of the most
expert Men in the Mystery of Surgery, might with the
Assent of twelve, or eight Persons at the least, of the same
Community, every Year elect and make out of the Community
two Masters or Governors, being the most expert
in the Mystery of Surgery, to oversee, rule and govern the
Mystery and Commonalty aforesaid, and all Men of the
same Mystery and the Affairs of the same; and that the
aforesaid Masters or Governors, and Commonalty, and
their Successors, might make Statutes and Ordinances for
the Government of the said Mysteries; and that the
Masters or Governors for the Time being, and their Successors,
should have the Survey, Search, Correction and
Government of all the Freemen of the said City, being
Surgeons, using the Mystery of Barbers in the same City,
and of other Surgeons whatsoever, being Foreigners,
practising and using the Mystery of Surgery, within the
same City and Suburbs of the same, and the Punishment
of them, as well Freemen as Foreigners, for their Offences
in not perfectly executing, performing and using that
Mystery; and should also have the Survey and Search of
all Manner of Instruments, Plaisters and other Medicines,
and the Receipts to be given, applied and used by the
said Barbers and Surgeons, for the curing and healing of
Sores, Wounds, Hurts and such like Infirmities; and that
no Barber using the said Mystery of Surgery, within the
said City, or Suburbs thereof, or other foreign Surgeon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_32'>a_32</span>whatsoever, should be in any Manner thereafter admitted
to execute, perform and exercise the same Mystery of
Surgery, unless he had first been approved of, as well
instructed in that Mystery, by the said Masters or Governors,
or their Successors, sufficiently qualified in that
Behalf; and his said Majesty did further grant, that the
said Masters or Governors of the Commonalty of the said
Mystery of Barbers, and their Successors, nor any of them,
should in any Manner thereafter be summoned or put
upon any Assizes, Juries, Inquests, Inquisitions, Attaints
or other Recognizances, to be taken within the said City
and Suburbs thereof, before the Mayor or Sheriffs, or
Coroners of the same City for the Time being, or summoned
by any of his Officer or Officers, Minister or
Ministers, although such Juries, Inquisitions, or Recognizances,
should be summoned upon a Writ or Writs of
Right; but that the said Masters or Governors, and
Commonalty of the aforesaid Mystery, and their Successors,
and every of them, should be thereof acquitted,
and wholly discharged for ever; and his said then Majesty
thereby further granted unto the aforesaid Masters
or Governors, and Commonalty of the said Mystery of
Barbers, and to their Successors the following Liberty;
to wit, That they at all Times thereafter should and might
admit Persons able and sufficiently learned and instructed
in the said Mystery of Surgery, and by them approved of
in Form, and presented to the Mayor of the said City
for the Time being, and no other Persons, or in any other
Manner, into the said Mystery of Barber Surgeons, and
Liberty of the said City: And whereas by an Act of
Parliament made and passed in the thirty-second Year
of the Reign of the late King Henry the Eighth, intituled,
<i>For Barbers and Surgeons</i>, after taking Notice that it
was very expedient and needful to provide for Men expert
in the Science of Physick and Surgery for the Health of
Man’s Body, when Infirmities and Sickness should happen;
for the due Exercise and Maintenance whereof, good and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_33'>a_33</span>necessary Acts had theretofore been made and provided,
and that within the City of <i>London</i>, Men of great Experience,
as well in Speculation as in Practice of the
Science and Faculty of Surgery, were abiding and inhabiting,
and had more commonly the daily Exercise and
Experience of the same Science of Surgery than was had
and used within any Parts of the Realm; and by Occasion
thereof, many expert Persons were brought up under them
as their Servants, Apprentices and others, who by the
Exercise and diligent Information of their Masters, might
exercise the said Science within divers other Parts of the
Realm; to the great Relief, Comfort and Succour of much
People, and to the Safeguard of their bodily Health,
Limbs and Lives; and reciting, That within the said City
of <i>London</i> there were then two several and distinct Companies
of Surgeons occupying and exercising the Science
and Faculty of Surgery, the one Company being commonly
called <i>The Barbers of</i> London, and the other Company
called <i>The Surgeons of</i> London; and that the said Company
of Barbers were incorporated to sue and be sued by
the Name of <i>Masters or Governors of the Mystery or
Commonalty of the Barbers of</i> London, by Letters Patent
under the Great Seal of King Edward the Fourth, dated
the twenty-fourth Day of <i>February</i> in the first Year of
his Reign, and which were confirmed by several subsequent
Letters Patents in the said Act mentioned and referred
to; and that the other Company, called <i>The Surgeons</i>,
had not any Manner of Corporation; and that the said two
several and distinct Companies of Surgeons were necessary
to be united and made one Body Corporate, to the Intent
that by their Union and often Assembly together, the
good and due Order, Exercise and Knowledge in the said
Science or Faculty of Surgery, should be, as well in
Speculation as in Practice, both to themselves and their
Servants and Apprentices, and by their Learning and
diligent and ripe Informations, more perfect, speedy and
effectual; it was therefore enacted, That the said two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_34'>a_34</span>several and distinct Companies of Surgeons, that is to say,
both the Barbers and the Surgeons, and every Person of
them, being a Freeman of either of the said Companies,
after the Custom of the said City of <i>London</i>, and their
Successors, should from thenceforth be immediately united
and made one entire and whole Body Corporate, and one
Commonalty perpetual, which at all Times thereafter
should be called by the Name of <i>Masters or Governors of
the Mystery or Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons of</i>
London, and by the same Name to implead and be impleaded
before all Manner of Justices in all Courts, in all
Manner of Actions and Suits; and also to purchase, enjoy,
and take to them and their Successors, Lands, Tenements,
Rents and other Possessions whatsoever: And it was also
thereby enacted, That they should have a Common Seal
to serve for the Business of the said Company and Corporation;
and that they should by the same Name, peaceably,
quietly and indefeazibly, have, possess, and enjoy,
to them and their Successors for ever, all such Lands and
Tenements, and other Hereditaments whatsoever, which
the said Company or Commonalty of Barbers then had and
enjoyed, to the Use of the said Mystery and Commonalty
of Barbers of <i>London</i>; and should also peaceably and
quietly have and enjoy all and singular Benefits, Grants,
Liberties, Privileges, Franchises and Free Customs, and
also all Manner of other Things at any Time given or
granted unto the said Companies of Barbers or Surgeons,
by whatsoever Name or Names they or any of them were
called, or which they or any of them, or any of their
Predecessors, then or theretofore had by Acts of Parliament,
Letters Patents or otherwise, by any lawful Means
at any Time before the said Act, in as large and ample
Manner and Form, as they or any of them, had, might or
should enjoy the same, notwithstanding the said Union
or Conjunction of the said Companies, and as if the same
were and had been specially and particularly expressed
and declared, with the best and most clearest Words and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_35'>a_35</span>Terms of Law, to all Intents and Purposes: And it was
thereby also enacted, That all Persons of the said Company
incorporated by the said Act, and their Successors,
that should be lawfully admitted and approved to occupy
Surgery after the Form of the Statute in that case made
and provided, should be exempt from bearing of Armour,
or to be put in any Watches or Inquests; and that they
and their Successors, should have the Search, Oversight,
Punishment and Correction, as well of Freemen as of
Foreign, for such Offences as they or any of them, should
commit against the good Order of Barbery and Surgery,
as theretofore among the said Company of Barbers of
<i>London</i> had been used and accustomed, according to the
Rules and Ordinances by them made and approved of,
pursuant to the Statute in that Behalf ordained and provided:
And it was thereby further enacted, That no
Person within the City of <i>London</i>, Suburbs of the same,
and one Mile Compass of the said City, using any Barbery
or Shaving, should occupy any Surgery, letting of Blood,
or any other Thing belonging to Surgery, except Drawing
of Teeth only: and that whosoever should use the Mystery
or Craft of Surgery within the Circuit aforesaid, should,
as long as he should use the said Mystery or Craft, in no
wise occupy or exercise the Feat or Craft of Barbery or
Shaving: And whereas in and by certain Letters Patents
under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, bearing Date the
fifteenth Day of <i>August</i> in the fifth Year of the Reign of
his late Majesty King Charles the First, reciting the said
Act of Parliament of the thirty-second Year of the Reign
of King Henry the Eighth; and that the Men of the
same Societies, as well from the Time of their said Union
and Incorporation as before, respectively had, held, used
and enjoyed divers Liberties, Franchises, Immunities,
Customs and Preheminences, within the City of <i>London</i>,
the Suburbs and Liberties thereof, and certain Villages,
and Places thereto adjacent, as well on account of the said
Act of Parliament, and other Acts of Parliament, as by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_36'>a_36</span>virtue and on account of divers Charters and Letters
Patents made and granted by the late King James the
First, and other Kings and Queens of <i>England</i>, his said
Majesty King Charles the First did thereby grant, ratify
and confirm unto the said Masters and Governors of the
Mystery and Commonalty aforesaid, and their Successors,
all and singular the Manors, Messuages, Lands, Tenements,
Customs, Liberties, Franchises, Immunities, Jurisdictions
and Hereditaments whatsoever, as well within the
City of <i>London</i>, the Liberties and Suburbs thereof, as
within the Liberties and Precincts therein after mentioned,
which the Men of the aforesaid Societies of Barbers and
Surgeons, or either of them, then lawfully had, held, used
and enjoyed, by reason of any Letters Patents of any
the former Kings and Queens of <i>England</i>, or by Colour
of any lawful Prescription, Use, or Custom, or by any
other lawful Means, Rights or Title theretofore had, used
or accustomed: And his said late Majesty King Charles
the First did thereby give Power to the said Company and
Corporation to make Bye-laws for the good Order and
Government of the said Society, in such Manner, and
under such Restrictions, as is therein mentioned; and to
make annual Elections of Masters or Governors of the
said Commonalty, whereof two to be Professors in the Art
and Science of Surgery; and also to elect and constitute
ten of the Freemen of that Society to be Examiners of the
Surgeons of <i>London</i>, during their Lives: And it was
thereby further granted, That no Person or Persons whatsoever,
whether a Freeman of the said Society, or a
Foreigner, or a Native of <i>England</i>, or an Alien, should
use or exercise the said Art or Science of Surgery within
the said Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>, or either of
them, or within the Distance of seven Miles of the said
City of <i>London</i>, for his or their private Lucre or Profit,
(except such Physicians as are therein mentioned) unless
the said Person or Persons were first tried and examined
in the Presence of two or more of the Masters or Governors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_37'>a_37</span>of the Mystery and Commonalty aforesaid for the Time
being, by four or more of the said Examiners so to be
elected and constituted as aforesaid, and by the publick
Letters Testimonial of the same Masters or Governors
under their Common Seal approved of, and admitted to
exercise the said Art Or Science of Surgery, according to
the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom of <i>England</i>, under
the Penalty in the said Letters Patents mentioned; and
that all and every of the said Freemen and Surgeons so
examined, approved of, and admitted as aforesaid, might
lawfully use and exercise the same Art and Science of
Surgery, as well within the Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>,
the Liberties and Suburbs thereof, as in any other
Cities, Towns, Boroughs and Places whatsoever of the
Kingdom of <i>England</i>: And it was thereby further granted
and provided, That the said Masters and Governors of the
Mystery and Commonalty aforesaid, and their Successors,
might appoint and have a publick Lecture for the Art and
Science of Surgery in their common Hall, or other convenient
Place, every Week or otherwise, at the Discretion
of the said Masters or Governors and their Assistants, or
the major Part of them for the Time being, to be held for
the better Instruction and Information in the Principles
and Rudiments of the Art and Science of Chirurgery of
all and singular as well Freemen as Foreigners, whether
native Subjects of <i>England</i> or Aliens, to be entered and
admitted as is therein mentioned: And it was thereby
also constituted and ordained, That no one, whether a
Freeman of the Mystery or Commonalty aforesaid, or a
Foreigner, whether a Native of <i>England</i>, or an Alien,
exercising the Art of Surgery within the Cities of <i>London</i>
and <i>Westminster</i>, or the Suburbs or Liberties thereof, or
within seven Miles of the said City of <i>London</i>, should go
out from the Port of <i>London</i>, or send out any Apprentice,
Servant or other Person whomsoever, from the same Port,
to execute or undertake the Place or Office of a Surgeon
for any Ship, whether in the Service of the Crown, or of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_38'>a_38</span>any Merchant or others, unless they and their Medicines,
Instruments and Chests respectively, were first examined,
inspected and allowed by two such Masters or Governors
of the Mystery and Commonalty aforesaid for the Time
being, as were skilled, knowing and Professors in the same
Art of Surgery, under the Penalty therein mentioned:
And whereas, since the said Act for Incorporation of the
said two Companies, those of the said Company practising
Surgery, have from their sole and constant Study of and
Application to the said Science, rendered the Profession
and Practice thereof of great Benefit to this Kingdom:
And whereas the Barbers belonging to the said <a id='cor'></a>Corporation
are now, and for many Years have been engaged
and employed in a Business foreign to, and independent
of the Practice of Surgery; and the Surgeons belonging
to the same Corporation being now become a numerous
and considerable Body, and finding their Union with the
Barbers inconvenient in many Respects, and in no Degree
conducive to the Progress or Improvement of the Art of
Surgery; and that a Separation of the Corporation of
Barbers and Surgeons, and making two Corporations of
the present united Company of Barbers and Surgeons,
will contribute much to the Improvement of Surgery,
and thereby become a Matter of publick Utility, are
therefore desirous that the Surgeons being Freemen of the
said Company, may be made a Corporation separate and
distinct from and Independent of the Barbers of and
belonging to the said Company;’ May it therefore please
your most Excellent Majesty that it may be enacted; and
be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled,
and by the Authority of the same, That the said

of <i>Masters, Governors and Commonalty of the Art and

</div>

<p class='c028'>The Kings most Excellent Majesty having directed
his Letters to the Right honourable Thomas Lord Ellesmere,
Lord Chancellor of England, and to Sir John Popham Knight,
Lord Chief Justice of England and one of his Highnesses
most honourable Privy Council, They the said Lord Chancellor
and Lord Chief Justice by virtue of the same Letters
called unto them Sir Thomas Fleminge Knight, then Lord
Chief Baron of his Majesty’s Court of Exchequer, Sir Thomas
Walmesley &amp; Sir Peter Warburton, Knights, two of his
Majesty’s Justices of the Court of Common Pleas, and Sir
David Williams and Sir Laurence Tanfield Knights two of
his Majesties Justices of the King’s Bench, and after due
consideration had both of the Charter of King Henry the
eighth made unto the said President and College of Physicians
in the tenth year of his Reign, and several Acts of Parliament
thereof made, one in the fourteenth year of the same
King, and the other in the first year of Queen Mary, for
the ordering and governing of the said College and of all the
Practisers in <i>London</i> and seven miles compass, did on the
first of May 1607 at the house of the said Lord Chancellor
called <i>York</i> House, resolve the several questions hereafter
mentioned, as is expressed under every Question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 1. Whether Graduates of Oxford and Cambridge
may practise in <i>London</i> or seven miles compass of the same
without licence under the said College Seal, by virtue of the
clause in the end of the Statute of 14. H. 8. and whether
that clause hath not relation to the Statute of 3. H. 8. onely,
or how far it doth extend?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. All resolved, that no Graduate that is not admitted
and licenced by the President and College of Physicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_95'>a_95</span>under their Common Seal, could practise in London or within
7 miles compass of the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 2. Whether, by Graduates, Graduates in Physick
onely are to be <a id='und'></a>understood?——</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. They resolved That the exception in the Statute
of 14. H. 8. cap. 5. of Graduates in the two Universities,
is to be understood onely of Graduates of Physick
and of no others. And all resolved, That by that exception
those Graduates may practise in all other places of <i>England</i>
out of <i>London</i> and 7 miles of the same without examination;
But not in <i>London</i> nor within the said Circuit of 7 miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 3. If Graduates not admitted to practise in <i>London</i>
practise there, whether, for evil practice or misdemeanor
therein, they be not subject to the Corporation and
Government of the College?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. They all agreed, That they are subject to the
Government and correction of the College by an express
Clause of the said Charter enacted which giveth to the President
and College <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Supervisionem Scrutinium, Correctionem
&amp; Gubernationem</span></i> as well of all persons using the practise
of Medicine within the City &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 4. If they may not practise without admission
of the College (as their Letters Patents plainly import)
Then whether such Graduates are not subject to the examination,
without which there were never any admitted; and
without which the admission cannot be approved; because
every Graduate is not absolutely good <i>ipso facto</i>?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. It was resolved by all That all that practised or
should practise Physick either in <i>London</i> or within the compass
of seven miles of the same, must submit themselves to
the examination of the President and College if they be
required thereunto by their authority notwithstanding any
licence, allowance or privilege given them in <i>Oxford</i> or
<i>Cambridge</i> either by their degree or otherwise.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_a_96'>a_96</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>Concerning Punishment &amp; Correction against Offenders.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Quest. 1. Whether the President and four Censors together,
or the Censors alone may not commit to Prison
without bail or mainprize all Offenders in the Practice of
Physick according to the Statute of <i>primo Mariæ</i> and how
long, whether till he have paid such Fine as shall be assessed
upon him, or have submitted himself to their Order, and
in what manner?——</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. They all resolved, That for not well doing using
or practising the faculty or Art or Physick or for disobedience
or contempts done and committed against any Ordinance
made by the College, by virtue and according to the
power and authority to them granted, they may commit the
Offenders without bail or mainprize, as the words of the
Statute are. Which they all resolved, would not be altered
or interpreted otherwise than the express words of the
Statute are.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 2. Whether they may not commit to prison for
disobedience and contempt of the private Statutes and Ordinances
of the College made for the better Government
thereof, and for not payment of such reasonable fines as
shall be imposed by the President and Censors for maintenance
of the said College, among the Members of the same
College?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. They all resolved, That the President and College
might commit to prison for offences and disobedience done
and committed against any lawfull Ordinance made by the
said College, and might impose reasonable fines for the
breach thereof, and detain the parties committed till these
fines were satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 3. Whether they may not justly take upon every
admission a reasonable sum of money for the better maintenance
and defraying of necessary expences, as in other Corporations?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_97'>a_97</span>Resp. They all held That they might take such reasonable
sums.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 4. Whether those onely are to be committed that
are Offenders in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non bene exequendo, faciendo &amp; utendo
facultate Medicinæ</span></i>, as in the Letters Patents; and such as
are sufficient and not admitted, are to be sued for 5 li. a
month and not be committed?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. They all held That by the Charter and Acts of
Parliament they might commit Offenders and Practisers that
offended in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non bene exequendo faciendo et utendo facultate</span></i>:
But for the committing to prison of such as practise (not
being admitted by the College) they held it doubtful, for
that the Charter and Statute do in that case inflict a punishment
of 5 li. a month against such practiser without admittance
by the College. But they all resolved, That if the
President and College made an Ordinance to prohibit the
practising of all without admittance under the common Seal
of the said College, That for breach and contempt of this
Ordinance, the President and College might both impose a
reasonable fine upon the Offender and commit him without
bail or mainprize.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. 5. Whether refusal to come to be examined upon
warning given be not a sufficient cause of Commitment?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. They all resolved, That if the College do make
an Ordinance, That if any Practiser of Physick in <i>London</i>
or within 7 miles of the same shall obstinately refuse to be
examined by the Censors of the College <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in non bene exequendo
faciendo &amp; utendo</span></i> the Art of Physick in his Medicines
or Receipts that the said President or Censors may
commit him to prison, there to remain without bail or
mainprize, untill he be delivered by the President and
Censors and to forfeit and pay to the said College some reasonable
sum of money, That the same Ordinance will be
good and lawfull. And if any after shall offend contrary to
the said Ordinance, the President and Censors may lawfully
commit such Offender to prison, there to remain without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_98'>a_98</span>bail or mainprize untill he shall be delivered by the said
President and Censors.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>It pleased the Lord Chancellor to move these Questions to the Judges as material for the execution of the Statutes.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>1 Quest. Whether the party committed for <a id='uns'></a>unskilful or
temerarious practice may have an action of false imprisonment
against them, and thereby draw in question or issue
the goodness or badness of the Physick?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. All resolved, That the Party so committed was
concluded by the sentence and judgement of the 4 Censors
of the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>2 Quest. Whether if any not admitted do practise Physick
within London or 7 miles of the same but once twice
or thrice in one month, be an Offender against the Charter
and Statutes of the College?</p>

<p class='c000'>Resp. All resolved it was, if he be a professed Physician.</p>

<p class='c029'>These I conceive to be the resolutions of their
Lordships and the Judges upon the Questions
which I humbly refer to themselves to affirm
or disaffirm</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Thomas Bonham</span>, doctor in philosophy and physic,
brought an action of false imprisonment against Henry
Atkins, George Turner, Thomas Moundford, and John
Argent, doctors in physic, and John Taylor, and Wm.
Bowden yeomen; for that the defendants, the 10 Nov.
<i>anno</i> 4 <i>Jacobi</i>, did imprison him, and detain him in prison
seven days. The defendants pleaded the letters patent of
King H. 8. bearing date the 23 Septemb. <i>anno</i> 10 of his
reign, by which he recites, <a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod cum Regii officii sui,
&amp;c.</span></i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod vide ante p.</span></i> 7.) But the case at bar doth
principally consist on two clauses in the charter. The first,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">concessimus etiam eisdem presidenti, &amp;c.</span></i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod vide ante
p.</span></i> 10). The second clause is, which immediately follows
in these words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præterea voluit, &amp;c.</span></i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod vide ante p.</span></i> 10.)
And afterwards, by act of Parliament made <i>anno</i> <a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a>14
H. 8. it was enacted, that the said corporation, and every
grant, article, and other things in the said letters patent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_100'>a_100</span>contained and specified, should be approved, granted,
ratified, and confirmed, &amp;c. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in tam amplo &amp; largo modo
prout poterit acceptari, cogitari, et construi per easdem
literas patentes</span></i>. And further it was enacted, that the said
six persons named in the said letters patent, as principal
of the said college, should elect to them two other of
the said college, who should be named <i>electi</i>, and that
the said elects should chose one of them to be president, as
by the said act appears: and further, they pleaded the act
of <a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a>1 <i>Mariæ</i>, by which it is enacted, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod quædam concessio,
&amp;c.</span></i> And further it was enacted, “That whensoever
the president of the college, or commonalty of the faculty
of physic at London for the time being, or such as the
said president and college shall yearly, according to the
tenor and meaning of the said act, authorize to search,
examine, correct, and punish all offenders and transgressors
in the said faculty, &amp;c. shall send or commit any
such offender or offenders for his or their offence or disobedience,
contrary to any article or clause contained in
the said grant or act, to any ward, gaol, or prison, &amp;c.”
(see p. 26.) And further pleaded, that the said Thomas
Bonham, 10 April, 1606, within London, against the form
of the said letters patent, and the said acts, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exercebat
artem medicinæ, non admissus per literas præd’ presidentis
&amp; collegii sigillo eorum communi sigillat’ ubi revera præd’
Tho. Bonham fuit minus sufficiens ad artem medicinæ exercend’</span></i>.
By force of which, the said Thomas Bonham, 30
<i>Aprilis</i> 1606, was summoned in London by the censors or
governors of the college, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad comparend’ coram præsiden’ &amp;
censor’ sive gubernatorib’ collegii præd’</span></i> at the college, &amp;c.
the 14th day of April next following, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">super præmissis
examinand’</span></i>. At which day the said Tho. Bonham came
before the president and censors, and was examined by the
censors <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de scientiâ suâ in facultate suâ in medicin’ administrand’.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_101'>a_101</span>Et quia præd’ Thomas Bonham sic examinatus

&amp; inventus fuit super examinationem præd’ per præed’

&amp;c. quousque inventus fuerit sufficiens, &amp;c. sub pœna
conjiciendi in carcerem si in præmissis delinqueret</span></i>. And
that the said T. Bonham, 20 Octo. 1606, within London did
practice physic, and the same day he was summoned by the
censors to appear before the president and them, 22 Octob.
then next following, at which day Bonham made default:
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ideo consideratum fuit per præd’ censores</span></i>, that for his disobedience
and contempt he should be amerced to 10l. and
that he should be arrested and committed to custody; and
afterward, 7 Nov. 1606, the said T. Bonham, at their assembly
came before the president and censors, and they
asked him if he would satisfy the college for his disobedience
and contempt, and submit himself to be examined,
and obey the censure of the college, who answered, that he
had practised and would practise physic within London,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nulla a collegio petita venia</span></i>, and that he would not submit
himself to the president and censors, and affirmed, that the
president and censors, had no authority over those who
were doctors in the university; for which cause, the said
four censors, <i>sc.</i> Dr. Turner, Dr. Moundford, Dr. Argent,
and Dr. Dun, then being censors or governors, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro offensis
et inobedientia præd’ adtunc &amp; ib’ ordinaverunt &amp; decreverunt,
quod præd’ T. Bonham in carcerem mandaretur ib’
remansur’ quousque abinde per præsident’ &amp; censores, seu
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_102'>a_102</span>gubernatores collegii præd’ pro tempore existen’ deliberaretur</span></i>,
and there then by their warrant in writing, under
their common seal, did commit the plaintiff to the prison of
the Compter of London, &amp;c. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">absque ballio sive manucapt’
ad custagia &amp; onera ipsius T. Bonham, donec præd’ T.
Bonham per præcept’ præsiden’ &amp; censor’ collegii præd’
sive successor’ suor’ liberatus esset</span></i>; and Dr. Atkins then
president, and the censors, and Bowden and Taylor as their
servants and by the commandment of the said president and
censors, did carry the plaintiff with the warrant, to the
gaol, &amp;c. which is the same imprisonment. The plaintiff
replied and said, that by the said act of 14 H. 8. it was
further enacted, “And where that in the dioceses of England,
out of London, it is not like to find alway men able
sufficiently to examine (after the statute) such as shall be
admitted to exercise physic in them, that it may be
enacted in this present Parliament, that no person from
henceforth be suffered to exercise or practise physic
through England, until such time that he be examined at
London by the said president and three of the said elects,
and to have from them letters testimonial of their approving
and examination, except he be a graduate of
Oxford or Cambridge, which have accomplished all
things for his form without any grace;” and that the
plaintiff, <i>anno Dom.</i> 1595, was a graduate, <i>sc.</i> a doctor in
the university of Cambridge, and had accomplished all
things concerning his degree for his form without <a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a>grace,
by force whereof he had exercised and practised physic
within the city of London until the defendants had imprisoned
him, &amp;c. upon which the defendant demurred in
law. And this case was often argued by the Serjeants at
bar in divers several terms; and now this term the case was
argued by the Justices, and the effect of their arguments
who argued against the plaintiff (which was divided into
three parts) shall be first reported. The first was, whether
a doctor of physic of the one university or the other, be by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_103'>a_103</span>the letters patent, and by the body of the act of 14 H. 8.
restrained from practising physic within the City of London,
&amp;c. The second was, if the exception in the said act of
<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a>14 H. 8. has excepted him or not. The third was, that his
imprisonment was lawful for his said disobedience. And as
to the first, they relied upon the letter of the grant, ratified
by the said act of 14 H. 8. which is in the negative, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sc. nemo
in dictâ civitate, &amp;c. exerceat dictam facultatem nisi ad hoc
per prædict’ præsidentem &amp; communitatem, &amp;c. admissus
sit, &amp;c.</span></i> And this proposition is a general negative, but
<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">generale dictum est generaliter intelligendum</span></i>; and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemo</span></i>
excludes all; and therefore a doctor of the one university or
the other, is prohibited within this negative word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemo</span></i>.
And many cases were put where negative statutes shall be
taken <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">stricte et exclusive</span></i>, which I do not think necessary to
be recited here. Also they said, that the statute of
<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a>3 H. 8. c. 11. which in effect is repealed by this act of
<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a>14 H. 8. has a special proviso for the universities of Cambridge
and Oxford, which being here left out, doth declare
the intention of the makers of the act, that they did intend
to include them within this general prohibition, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemo in
dictâ civitate, &amp;c.</span></i> As to the second point they strongly
held, that the said latter clause, “and where that in the
dioceses of England, out of London,” &amp;c. this clause,
according to the words, extends only to places out of London,
and so much the rather, because they provided for
London before, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemo in dictâ civitate, &amp;c.</span></i> Also the makers
of the act put a distinction betwixt those who shall be
licensed to practise physic in London, &amp;c. for they ought to
have the admittance and allowance of the president and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_104'>a_104</span>college in writing, under their common seal; but he who
shall be allowed to practise physic throughout England, out
of London, ought to be examined and admitted by the
president and three of the elects, and so they said, that it
was lately adjudged in the King’s Bench, in an information
exhibited against the said Dr. Bonham for practising physic
in London for divers months. As to the third point they
said, that for his contempt and disobedience before them at
their assembly in their college, they might well commit him
to prison for they have authority by the letters patent and
act of Parliament, and therefore for a contempt or misdemeanor
before them they may commit him. Also the act
of <a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c013'><sup>[120]</sup></a>1 M. has given them power to commit them for every
offence or disob. contrary to any article or clause contained
in the said grant or act. But there is an express
negative article in the said grant, and ratif. by the act of
14 H. 8. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod nemo in dictâ civitate, &amp;c. exerceat, &amp;c.</span></i> and
the defendants have pleaded, that the plaintiff had practised
physic in London by the space of one month, &amp;c. and
therefore the act of 1 <i>Mariæ</i> has authorised them to imprison
him in this case; wherefore they concluded against
the plaintiff. But it was argued by Coke Chief Justice,
Warburton and Daniel Justices of the Common Pleas, to
the contrary. And Daniel Justice conceived, that a doctor
of physic, of the one university or the other, &amp;c. was not
within the body of the act, and if he was within the body of
the act, that he was excepted by the said latter clause; but
Warburton argued against him for both the points; and the
Chief Justice did not speak to those two points, because he
and Warburton and Daniel agreed, that this action was
clearly maintainable for two other points, and therefore in
this action the Chief Justice omitted to speak to the said
two points; but to two other points, he and the said two
other Justices, Warburton and Daniel, did speak, <i>sc.</i> 1.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_105'>a_105</span>Whether the censors have power, for the causes alledged
in their bar, to fine and imprison the plaintiff. 2. Admitting
that they have power to do it, if they had pursued their
power. But the Chief Justice, before he argued the points
in law, because much was said in commendation of the
doctors of physic of the college in London, and somewhat
(as he conceived) in derogation of the dignity of the doctors
of the universities, he first attributed much to the doctors of
the said college in London, and confessed that nothing was
spoke in their commendation which was not due to their
merits: but yet that no comparison was to be made between
that private college, and either of the universities of Cambridge
and Oxford, no more than between the father and
his children, or between the fountain and the small rivers
which descend from it; the university is <i>alma <a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c013'><sup>[121]</sup></a>mater</i>,
from whose breasts those of that private college have sucked
all their science and knowledge (which I acknowledge to be
great and profound) but the law saith, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">erubescit lex filios
castigare parentes</span></i>: the university is the fountain, and that
and the like private colleges are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanquam rivuli</span></i>, which flow
from the mountain, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et melius est petere fontes quam sectari
rivulos</span></i>. Briefly, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Academiæ <a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a>Cantabrigiæ &amp; Oxoniæ sunt
Athenæ nostræ nobilissimæ, regni soles, oculi &amp; animæ
regni, unde religio, humanitas, et doctrina in omnes regni
partes uberrimè diffunduntur</span></i>: but it is true, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nunquam
sufficiet copia laudatoris, quia nunquam deficiet materia
laudis</span></i>; and therefore these universities exceed and excel
all private colleges, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum inter virburna cupressus</span></i>.
And it was observed that K. H. 8. in his said letters patent
and the K. and the Parliam. in the act of 14 H. 8. in making
of a law concern. physicians, for the more safety and health
of men, therein follow the order of a good physician (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rex
<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c013'><sup>[123]</sup></a>enim omn’ artes censetur habere in scrinio pect’ sui</span></i>) for,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">medicina est duplex, removens, <a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a>&amp; promovens; removens
morbum, &amp; promovens ad salutem</span></i>: and therefore five manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_106'>a_106</span>of persons (who more hurt the body of man than the disease
itself, one of which said of one of their patients, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fugiens
morbum incidit in medicum</span></i>) are to be removed; 1. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Improbi.</span></i>
2. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Avari, qui medicinam magis <a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a>avaritiæ suæ causa quam
ullius bonæ conscientiæ fiducia profitentur.</span></i> 3. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malitiosi.</span></i>
4. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Temerarii.</span></i> 5. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inscii.</span></i> And of the other part five manner
of persons were to be promoted, as appears by the said
act, <i>sc.</i> those who were, 1. profound. 2. sad. 3. discreet.
4. groundly learned. 5. profoundly studied. And it was
well ordained, that the professors of physic should be profound,
sad, discreet, &amp;c. and not youths, who have no gravity
and experience; for as one saith, <a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In juvene theologo
conscientiæ detrimentum, in juvene legista bursæ detrimentum
in juvene medico cœmiterii incrementum.</span></i> And it
ought to be presumed, every doctor of any of the universities
to be within the statutes, <i>sc.</i> to be profound, sad,
discreet, groundly learned, and profoundly studied, for none
can there be master of arts (who is a doctor of philosophy)
under the study of seven years, and cannot be doctor in
physic under seven years more in the study of physic; and
that is the reason that the plaintiff is named in the declaration
doctor of Philosophy, and doctor of physic; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia
oportet medicum esse philosophum, <a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a>ubi enim philosophus
desinit, medicus incipit</span></i>: as to the two points upon which the
Chief Justice, Warburton and Daniel, gave judgment.
1. It was resolved by them, that the said censors had not
power to commit the plaintiff for any of the causes mentioned
in the bar; and the cause and reason thereof shortly
was, that the said clause, which gives power to the said
censors to fine and imprison, doth not extend to the said
clause, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sc. quod nemo in dictâ civitate</span></i>, &amp;c. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exerceat dictam
facultatem, &amp;c.</span></i> which prohibits every one from practising
physic in London, &amp;c. without licence from the president
and college; but extends only to punish those who practise
physic in London, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro delictis suis in non bene <a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a>exequendo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_107'>a_107</span>faciendo &amp; utendo facultate medicinæ</span></i>, by fine and imprisonment:
so that the censors have not power by the letters
patent, and the act, to fine and imprison any for practising
physic in London, but only <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro delictis suis in non bene
exequendo, &amp;c. sc.</span></i> for ill, and not good use and practice of
physic. And that was made manifest by five reasons, which
were called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vividæ rationes</span></i>, because they had their vigour
and life from the letters patent, and the act itself; and the
best <a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a>expositor of all letters patent, and acts of Parliament,
are the letters patent and the acts of Parliament
themselves, by construction, and conferring <a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a>all the
parts of them together, <a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Optima statuti interpretatrix est
(omnibus particulis ejusdem inspectis) ipsum statutum</span></i>; and
<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">injustum est nisi tota lege inspecta una aliqua ejus particula
proposita judicare vel respondere</span></i>. The first reason
was, that these two were two absolute, perfect, and distinct
clauses, and as parallels, and therefore the one did not
extend to the other; for the second begins, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præterea voluit
et concessit, &amp;c.</span></i> and the branch concerning fine and imprisonment
is parcel of the 2d clause. 2. The first clause prohibiting
the practice of physic, &amp;c. comprehends four
certainties: 1. Certainty of the thing prohibited, <i>sc.</i> practice
of physic. 2. Certainty of the time, <i>sc.</i> practice for one
month. 3. Certainty of penalty, <i>sc.</i> 5l. 4. Certainty in
distribution, <i>sc.</i> one moiety to the King, and the other
moiety to the college, and this penalty he who practises
physic in London incurs, although he practises and uses
physic well, and profitable for the body of man; and on this
branch the information was exhibited in the King’s Bench.
But the clause to punish <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">delicta in non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</span></i>
on which branch the case at bar stands, is altogether uncertain,
for the hurt which may come thereby may be little or
great, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">leve vel grave</span></i>, excessive or small, &amp;c. and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_108'>a_108</span>the King and the makers of the act could not, for an offence
so uncertain, impose a certainty of the fine, or time of
imprisonment, but leave it to the censors to punish such
offences, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum quantitatem delicti</span></i>, which is included in
these words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fines, amerciamenta, imprisonamenta corporum
suorum, et per alias vias rationibiles et congruas</span></i>.
2. The harm which accrues by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</span></i>
concerns the body of man; and therefore it is reasonable
that the offender should be punished in his body, sc. by
imprisonment; but he who practises physic in London in a
good manner, although he doth it without licence, yet it is
not any prejudice to the body of man. 3. He who practises
physic in Lon. doth not offend the statute by his practice,
unless he practises it by the space of a month. But the
clause of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</span></i> doth not prescribe any
certain time, but at what time soever he ministers physic
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non bene, &amp;c.</span></i> he shall be punished by the said second
branch: and the law hath great reason in making this
distinction, for divers nobles, <a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a>gentlemen, and others,
come upon divers occasions to London, and when they are
here they become subject to diseases, and thereupon they
send for their physicians in the country, who know their
bodies, and the cause of their diseases; now it was never
the meaning of the act to bar any one of his own physician;
and when he is here he may practise and minister to another
by two or <a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c013'><sup>[134]</sup></a>three weeks, &amp;c. without any forfeiture; for
any one who practises physic <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bene, &amp;c.</span></i> in London (although
he has not taken any degree in any of the universities) shall
forfeit nothing, unless he practises it by the space of a
month; and that was the reason that the time of a month
was put in the act. 4. The censors cannot be <a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a>judges,
ministers, and parties; judges to give sentence or judgment;
ministers to make summons; and parties to have the moiety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_109'>a_109</span>of the forfeiture, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia <a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c013'><sup>[136]</sup></a>aliquis non debet esse Judex in
propriâ causâ, imo iniquum est aliquem suæ rei esse judicem</span></i>;
and one cannot be judge and attorney for any of the parties,
Dyer 3 E. 6. 65. 38 E. 3. 15. 8 H. 6. 19. b. 20. a. 21 E. 4.
47. a. &amp;c. And it appears in our books, that in many cases,
the common law will <a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a>controul acts of Parliament, and
sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void: for when an
act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or
repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law
will controul it, and adjudge such act to be void: and therefore
in 8 E. 3. 30. a. b. Thomas Tregor’s case on the statute
of W. 2. c. 38. &amp; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">artic’ super chartas</span></i>, c. 9. Herle <a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c013'><sup>[138]</sup></a>saith,
some statutes are made against law and right, which those
who made them perceiving, would not put them in execution:
the stat. of W. 2. <a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c013'><sup>[139]</sup></a>c. 21 gives a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cessavit
hæredi petenti super hæredem tenent’ &amp; super eos quibus
alienatum fuerit hujusmodi tenementum</span></i>: and yet it is adjudged
in 33 E. 3. <a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a><i>Cessavit</i> 42. where the case was, two
coparceners lords, and tenant by fealty and certain rent, one
coparcener had issue and died, the aunt and the niece shall
not join in a <i>Cessavit</i>, because the heir <a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a>shall not have a
<i>Cessavit</i> for the cesser in the time of his ancestor, F. N. B.
209. F. and therewith agrees Plow. Com. 110. a. and the
reason is, because in a <i>Cessavit</i> the tenant before judgment
may render the arrearages and damages, &amp;c. and retain his
land, and that he cannot do when the heir brings a <i>Cessavit</i>
for the cesser in the time of his ancestor, for the arrearages
incurred in the life of the ancestor do not belong to the
heir: and because it would be against common right and
reason, the common law adjudges the said act of Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_110'>a_110</span>as to that point void. The statute of <a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a>Carlisle, made
<i>anno</i> 35 E. 1. enacts, that the order of the Cistercians and
Augustines, who have a convent and common seal, that the
common seal shall be in the keeping of the Prior, who is
under the Abbot, and four others of the most grave of the
house, and that any deed sealed with the common seal,
which is not so in keeping shall be void: and the opinion
of the court (<i>in an.</i> 27 H. 6. Annuity 41.) was, that this
statute was <a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a>void, for it is impertinent to be observed,
for the seal being in their keeping, the Abbot cannot seal
any thing with it, and when it is in the Abbot’s hands, it is
out of their keeping <i>ipso facto</i>; and if the statute should
be <a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a>observed, every common seal shall be defeated upon
a simple surmise, which cannot be tried. Note reader the
words of the said statute at Carlisle, <i>anno</i> 35 E. 1. (which
is called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Statutum religiosorum</span></i>) are, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et insuper ordinavit
dominus Rex &amp; statuit, quod Abbates Cisterc’ &amp; Præmonstraten’
ordin’ religiosorum, &amp;c. de cætero habeant sigillum
commune, et illud in custodia Prioris monasterii seu
domus, et quatuor de dignioribus et discretioribus ejusdem
loci conventus sub privato sigillo Abbatis ipsius loci custod’
depo, &amp;c. Et si forsan aliqua scripta obligationum, donationum,
emptionum, venditionum, alienationum, seu aliorum
quorumcunque, contractuum alio sigillo quam tali sigillo,
communi sicut præmittit’ custodit inveniant’ a modo sigillat’,
pro nullo penitus habeantur omnique careant firmitate.</span></i> So
the statute of 1 E. 6. c. 14. gives chauntries, &amp;c. to the
King, saving to the donor, &amp;c. all such rents, services, &amp;c.
and the common law controuls it, and adjudges it void as to
services, and the donor shall have the rent, as a rentseck,
distrainable of common right, for it would be against common
right and reason that the <a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a>King should hold of any,
or do service to any of his subjects, 14 Eliz. Dyer 313. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_111'>a_111</span>so it was adjudged Mich. 16 &amp; 17 Eliz. in <i>Com’ Banco</i>
in <a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a>Strowd’s case. So if any act of Parliament gives to
any to hold, or to have conusans of all manner of pleas
arising before him within his manor of D. yet he shall hold
no plea, to which he himself is party; for, as hath been
said, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">iniquum est aliquem suæ rei esse judicem</span></i>. 5. If he
should forfeit 5l. for one moiety by the first clause, and
should be punished for practising at any time by the second
clause, two absurdities should follow, 1. That one should
be punished not only twice but many times for one and the
same offence. And the divine saith, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod <a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a>Deus non
agit bis in idipsum</span></i>; and the law saith, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo debet bis
puniri pro uno delicto</span></i>. 2. It would be absurd, by the first
clause, to punish practising for a month, and not for a
lesser time, and by the second to punish practising not only
for a day, but at any time, so he shall be punished by the
first branch for one month by the forfeit of 5l. and by the
second by fine and imprisonment, without limitation for
every time of the month in which he practises physic.
<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a>And all these reasons were proved by two grounds, or
maxims in law; 1. <a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Generalis clausula non porrigitur
ad ea quæ specialiter sunt comprehensa</span></i>: and the case between
Carter and <a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a>Ringstead, Hil. 34 Eliz. Rot. 120. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
Communi Banco</span></i>, was cited to this purpose, where the case
in effect was, that A. seized of the manor of Staple in Odiham
in the county of Southampton in fee, and also of other lands
in Odiham aforesaid in fee, suffered a common recovery of
all and declared the use by indenture, that the recoverer
should stand seised of all the lands and tenements in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_112'>a_112</span>Odiham, to the use of A. and his wife, and to the heirs of
his body begotten; and further, that the recoverer should
stand seised to the use of him, and to the heirs of his body,
and died, and the wife survived, and entered into the said
manor by force of the said general words; but it was adjudged,
that they did not extend to the said manor which
was specially named: and if it be so in a deed, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i>, it
shall be so in an act of Parliament, which (as a will) is to
be expounded according to the intention of the makers.

12. a. b. Sir Adam de Clydrow Knight, brought a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præcipe
quod reddat</span></i> against John de Clydrow, and the writ was,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod juste, &amp;c. reddat manerium de Wicomb et duas carucatas
terræ cum pertinentiis in Clydrow</span></i>, in that case the
town of Clydrow shall not relate to the manor, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia non
indiget</span></i>, for a manor may be demanded without mentioning
that it lies in any town, but <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum pertinentiis</span></i>, although it
comes after the town, shall relate to the manor, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia indiget.</span></i>
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</span></i> 3 E. 4. 10. the like case. But it was objected, that
where by the second clause it was granted, that the censors
should have <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">supervisum et scrutinium, correctionem et gubernationem
omnium et singulorum medicorum, &amp;c.</span></i> they had
power to fine and imprison. To that it was answered, 1.
That <em>that</em> is but part of the sentence, for by the entire sentence
it appears in what manner they shall have power to
punish, for the words are, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ac punitionem eorum pro delictis
suis in non bene exequendo, faciendo, vel utendo illa facultate</span></i>;
so that without question all their power to correct and
punish the physicians by this clause is only limited to these
three cases, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sc. in non bene exequendo, faciendo, vel utendo,
&amp;c.</span></i> Also this word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">punitionem</span></i>, is limited and restrained
by these words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ita quod punitio eorundem medicorum, &amp;c.
sic in præmissis delinquentium, &amp;c.</span></i> which words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic in
præmissis delinquentium</span></i>, limit the former words in the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_113'>a_113</span>part of this sentence, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ac punitionem eorum pro delictis suis
in non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</span></i> 2. it would be absurd, that in
one and the same sentence the makers of the act should
give them a general power to punish without limitation;
and a special manner how they shall punish, in one and the
same sentence. 3dly, Hil. 38 Eliz. in a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo warranto</span></i>
against the Mayor and Commonalty of London, it was held,
that where a grant is made to the Mayor and Commonalty,
that the Mayor for the time being should have <a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c013'><sup>[153]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">plenum
et integrum scrutinium, gubernationem, et correctionem
omnium et singulorum mysteriorum, &amp;c.</span></i> without granting
them any court, in which should be legal proceedings, that
it is good for search, whereby a discovery may be made of
offences and defects, which may be punished by the law in
any court, but it doth not give, nor can give them any irregular
or absolute power to correct or punish any of the
subjects of the kingdom at their pleasure. 2. It was objected,
that it is incident to every court created by letters
patent, or act of Parliament, and other courts of record, to
punish any misdemeanor done in court, in disturbance or
contempt of the court, by imprisonment. To which it was
answered, that neither the letters patent nor the act of
Parliament has granted them any court, but only an
<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c013'><sup>[154]</sup></a>authority, which they ought to pursue, as it shall be afterwards
said. 2. If any court had been granted them, they
could not by any incident authority <i>implicitè</i> granted them,
for any misdemeanor done in court, commit him to prison
without bail or mainprize, until he should be by the commandment
of the president and censors, or their successors,
delivered, as the censors have done in this case. 3. There
was not any such misdemeanor for which any court might
imprison him, for he only shewed his case to them, which,
he was advised by his counsel, he might justify, which is
not any offence worthy of imprisonment. The second point
was, admitting that the censors had power by the act, if
they had pursued their authority, or not? And it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_114'>a_114</span>resolved by the Chief Justice, Warburton and Daniel, that
they had not pursued it for six reasons. 1. By the act, the
censors only have power to impose a fine, or amerciament;
and the president and censors imposed the amerciament of
5l. upon the plaintiff. 2. The plaintiff was summoned to
appear <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coram presidente et censoribus, &amp;c. et non comparuit</span></i>,
and therefore he was fined 10l. whereas the president had
no authority in that case. 3. The fines or amerciaments to
be imposed by them, by force of the act, do not belong to
them, but to the King, for the King had not granted the
fines or amerciaments to them, and yet the fine is appointed
to be paid to them, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in proximis comitiis</span></i>, and they have
imprisoned the plaintiff for non-payment thereof. 4. They
ought to have committed the plaintiff presently, by construction
of law, although that no time be limited in the act,
as in the statute of W. 2. cap. 11 <a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c013'><sup>[155]</sup></a><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De servientibus,
ballivis, &amp;. qui ad compotum reddend’ tenentur, &amp;c.
cum dom’ hujusmodi servientium dederit eis auditores
compoti, et contingat ipsos in arrearagiis super compotum
suum omnibus allocatis et allocandis, arrestentur corpora
eorum, et per testimonium auditorum ejusdem compoti
mittantur et liberentur proximæ gaolæ domini Regis in
partibus illis, etc.</span></i> In that case, although no time be limited
when the accomptant shall be imprisoned, yet it ought to
be done <a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c013'><sup>[156]</sup></a>presently, as it is held in 27 H. 6. 8. a. and the
reason thereof is given in Fogassa’s case, Plowd. Com. 17. b.
that the generality of the time shall be restrained to the
present time, for the benefit of him upon whom the pain
shall be inflicted, and therewith agrees Plow. Com. 206. b.
in Stradling’s case. And a Justice <a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c013'><sup>[157]</sup></a>of Peace upon view
of the force, ought to commit the offender presently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_115'>a_115</span>5. Forasmuch as the censors had their authority by the
letters patent and act of Parliament, which are high matters
of record, their proceedings ought not to be by parol, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp; eo
potius</span></i>, because they claim authority to fine and imprison,
and therefore, if judgment be given against one in the
Common Pleas in a writ of <a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c013'><sup>[158]</sup></a>recaption, he shall be fined
and imprisoned, but if the writ be vicontiel in the county,
there he shall not be fined nor imprisoned, because a writ
of the court is not of record, F. N. B. in Recaption; so in
F. N. B. 47. a. a plea of trespass <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span></i> doth not lie
in the county court, hundred court, &amp;c. for they cannot
make a record of fine and imprisonment; and regularly they
who cannot make <a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c013'><sup>[159]</sup></a>a record, cannot fine and imprison.
And therewith agrees 27 H. 6. 8. Book of Entries, tit.
Account, fol. —. The auditors make a record when they
commit the defendant to prison; a Justice of Peace upon
view of the force may commit, but he ought to make a
record of it. 6. Forasmuch as the act of 14 H. 8. has given
power to imprison till he shall be delivered by the president
and the censors, or their successors, reason requires that
it should be taken strictly, for the liberty of the subject
(as they pretend) is at their pleasure: and this is well
proved by a judgment in Parliament in this very case; for
when this act of 14 H. 8. had given the censors power to
imprison, yet it was taken so literally, that the gaoler was
not bound to receive such as they should commit to him, and
the reason thereof was, because they had authority to do it
without any court: and thereupon the statute of 1 Ma.
<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c013'><sup>[160]</sup></a>cap 9. was made, that the gaoler should receive them upon
a penalty, and yet none can commit any to prison, unless
the gaoler receives him: but the first act, for the cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_116'>a_116</span>aforesaid, was taken so literally, that no necessary incident
was implied. And where it was objected, that this very act
of 1 <i>Mar.</i> cap. 9. has enlarged the power of the censors, and
they urged it upon the words of the act; it was clearly
resolved, that the said act of 1. <i>Mar.</i> did not enlarge the
power of the censors to fine or imprison any person for any
cause for which he ought not to be fined and imprisoned by
the said act of <a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c013'><sup>[161]</sup></a>14. H. 8. For the words of the act of
Queen Mary are, “according to the tenor and meaning of
the said act:” also “shall send or commit any offender
or offenders for his or their offence or disobedience, contrary
to any article or clause contained in the said grant
or act, to any ward, gaol, &amp;c.” But in this case Bonham
has not done any thing which appears within this record,
contrary to any article or clause contained within the grant
or act of 14 H. 8. Also the gaoler who refuses shall forfeit
the double value of the fines and amerciaments that any
offender or disobedient shall be assessed to pay; which
proves that none shall be received by any gaoler by force of
the act of 14 H. 8. but he who may be lawfully fined or
amerced by the act of 14 H. 8. and that was not Bonham, as
by the reasons and causes aforesaid appears. And admitting
that the replication be not material, and the defendants
have demurred upon it; yet forasmuch as the defendants
have confessed in the bar, that they have imprisoned the
plaintiff without cause, the plaintiff shall have judgment:
and the difference is, when the plaintiff <a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a>replies, and by
his replication it appears that he has no cause of action,
there he shall never have judgment: but when the <a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a>bar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_117'>a_117</span>is sufficient in matter, or amounts (as the case is) to a confession
of the point of the action, and the plaintiff replies,
and shews the truth of the matter to enforce his case, and in
judgment of law it is not material, yet the plaintiff shall
have judgment, for it is true that sometimes the declaration
shall be made good by the bar, and sometimes the bar by
the replication, and sometimes the replication by the rejoinder,
&amp;c. but the difference is, when the declaration wants
time, place, or other <a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a>circumstance, it may be made good
by the bar, so of the bar, replication, &amp;c. as appears in 18
E. 4. 16. b. But when the declaration wants substance, no
bar can make it good; so of the bar, replication, &amp;c. and
therewith agrees 6. E. 4. 2. a good case, and <i>nota</i> there
<i>dictum</i> Coke. <i>Vide</i> 18 E. 3. 34. b. 44 E. 3. 7, a. 12 E.
4. 6. 6 H. 7. 10. 7 H. 7. 3. 11 H. 4. 24. &amp;c. But when
the plaintiff makes replication, sur-rejoinder, &amp;c. and thereby
it appears, that upon the <a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a>whole record the pl. has no cause
of action, he shall never have judgment, although the bar or
rejoinder, &amp;c. be insufficient in matter; for the court ought
to judge upon the whole record, and every one shall be
intended to make the best of his own case. <i>Vide</i>
<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a>Ridgeway’s case, in the Third Part of my Reports 52. b. and
so these differences were resolved and adjudged between
<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a>Kendal and Helyer, Mich. 25 &amp; 26 Eliz. in the K.’s Bench,
and Mich. 29 &amp; 30 Eliz. in the same court, between
<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a>Gallys and Burbry. And Coke Ch. Just. in the conclusion
of his argument observed seven things for the better direction
of the president and commonalty of the said college for the
future. 1. That none can be punished for practising physic
in London, but by forfeiture of 5l. by the month, which is
to be recovered by the law. 2. If any practise physic there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_118'>a_118</span>for a less time than a month, that he shall forfeit nothing.
3. If any person prohibited by the statute offends <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in non
bene exeq’ &amp;c.</span></i> they may punish him according to the stat.
within the month. 4. Those who they may commit to
prison by the stat. ought to be commit. <a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a>presently.
5. The fines which they set, according to the statute,
belong to the King. 6. They cannot impose a fine, or
imprisonment without a record of it. 7. The cause for
which they impose fine and imprisonment ought to be
certain, for it is <a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a>traversable: for although they have
letters patent, and an act of Parliament, yet because the
party grieved has no other remedy, neither by writ of error,
or otherwise, and they are not made Judges, nor a court
given them, but have an <a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a>authority only to do it, the
cause of their commitment is traversable in an action of
false imprisonment brought against them; as upon the
statute of <a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c013'><sup>[172]</sup></a>bankrupts, their warrant is under the great
seal, and by act of Parliament; yet because the party
grieved has no other remedy, if the commissioners do not
pursue the act and their commission, he shall traverse, that
he was not a bankrupt, although the commissioners affirm
him to be one; as this term it was resolved in this court, in
trespass between Cutt <a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c013'><sup>[173]</sup></a>and Delabarre, where the issue
was, whether Will. Cheyney was a bankrupt or not, who
was found by the commissioners to be a bankrupt; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i>
in the case at bar, the cause of the imprisonment is traversable;
for otherwise the party grieved may be perpetually,
without just cause, imprisoned by them; but the record of
a force made by a Justice of Peace is not traversable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_119'>a_119</span>because he doth it as Judge, by the statutes of <a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a>15 R. 2.
and 8 H. 6. and so there is a difference when one makes
a record as a Judge, and when he doth a thing by special
authority, (as they did in the case at bar) and not as a
Judge. And afterwards, for the said two last points, judgment
was given for the plaintiff, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullo contradicente</span></i>, as to
them. And I acquainted Sir Thomas Fleming, Chief
Justice of the King’s Bench, with this judgment, and with
the reasons and causes of it, and he well approved of the
judgment which we had given: and this is the first judgment
on the said branch concerning fine and imprisonment which
has been given since the making of the said charter and acts
of Parliament, and therefore I thought it worthy to be reported
and published.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was an action of trespass for an assault, battery,
wounding and false imprisonment. The defendants as to
the beating and wounding, plead not guilty, and as to the
residue of the trespass they justify; for that by letters patent
dated the 23 of September 10 H. 8 the king granted, that
they, viz. the doctors of physick in London, should be a
body and perpetual community, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per nomen præsidentis &amp;
collegii five communitat’ facultat’ medicin’ London’, &amp;c.</span></i>
and that they might make By-Laws; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp; quod quatour singulis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_120'>a_120</span>annis eligerentur qui haberent scrutinium correctionem
&amp; gubernationem omnium &amp; singulorum dictæ civitatis medicorum
&amp; aliorum medicorum forinsecorum facultate illa
utentium infra eandem civitatem &amp; suburbia, ac infra septem
milliaria in circuitu ejusdem, ac punitionem eorundem
pro delictis suis in non bene exercendo, &amp;c. per fines amerciamenta
&amp; imprisonamentum corporum suorum</span></i>; and that
these letters patent were confirmed by an act of parliament
of 14 H. 8. And that on the 1st of January 8 W. 3.
the plaintiff exercised the art of physick in London, and
that he administered bad and unwholesome physick to one
woman and that the said woman and her husband complained
to the defendants, being the censors of the said college;
upon which complaint the plaintiff was summoned before
them, and upon examination they found him guilty of administering
unwholesome physick, by means of which the
said woman languished; and thereupon they fined the plaintiff
20l. and made a warrant under their hands and seals to
—— —— who was also a defendant, to take the plaintiff;
who took him pursuant to such warrant and conveyed him
to prison; which is the residue of the trespass of which the
plaintiff complains. The plaintiff replies <i>protestando</i>, that
there are no such letters patent, and no such act of parliament;
and <i>protestando</i>, that the plaintiff did not administer
such unwholesome physick; that the defendants of their
own wrong committed the trespass; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">absque hoc quod</span></i>, that
the plaintiff was taken and committed by force of the said
warrant: and to this it was demurred. And this case was
divers times argued, and many exceptions were taken to the
plea and to the replication; and now this term judgment
was given for the defendants. And Holt C. J. delivered the
opinion of the court; and said, that the rest of the Judges
were agreed, that the replication of the plaintiff was ill, and
that the plea of the defendants was good. The plaintiff in
his replication traverses the taking by the warrant mentioned
in the plea of the defendants; and this is ill both in substance
and in form; for in point of form he ought not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_121'>a_121</span>traverse the taking by force of the warrant, but that there
was not any such warrant; for if it were necessary that the
arrest of the plaintiff should be by the same warrant that
was mentioned before in the pleading that if the defendants
had shewn in their plea another warrant than that which
was shewn at the time of the arrest, the plaintiff ought not
to have said, that he was not taken by this warrant but that
there was not any such warrant. But the replication is not
good in point of substance; for the plaintiff seems to intend,
that the warrant by which he was arrested was unlawful, yet
the plaintiff shall not have advantage of it, if there was
another warrant which was lawful to take him at the same
time; for if there are two warrants, the one lawful and the
other unlawful, and the party is taken upon the illegal
warrant, yet he who apprehends him may justify himself
by the authority of the legal warrant; and this appears by
the case Mich 34 Ed. 1 Fitz. Avowry, 232 cited 3 Co. 26. a.
If a man takes a distress for a thing for which he has not
good cause of distress, but had good cause of distress for
another thing; if a replevin is brought, and he comes into
court, he may avow for which thing he pleases. Then it
was considered whether the plea of the defendants was
good; to which it had been objected that it was ill for the
uncertainty; for the cause of the commitment being traversable
ought to be alleged with certainty. Secondly, That
by the plea it appears, that the plaintiff was fined and imprisoned
also; the censors (of the college of Physicians the
defendants) have authority to impose a fine, and to imprison
for non-payment of that fine, or they may imprison for the
offence; but they cannot both fine and imprison for the
same offence, as in this case; for it does not appear that the
imprisonment was for non-payment of the fine but the
plaintiff was both fined and imprisoned, and so was twice
punished for one offence. Thirdly, the plea does not shew
that the plaintiff was one of the college. Fourthly, The
plea makes no answer to the assault; it does not shew that
there was any assault, or set forth any justification of it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_122'>a_122</span>But Holt C. J. said that the Court held the plea to be good,
for it goes to the whole declaration; as to the battery and
wounding the defendants plead not guilty, as to the residue
of the trespass they justify; and the residue of the trespass
comprehends the assault, and every other part of the declaration
to which the plea (of not guilty) does not extend:
and there is no need that the plaintiff should be of the college;
for it appears that he exercised his faculty within
London and the censors have jurisdiction within London and
the suburbs, and seven miles in circumference; and it appears
by the words of the Charter, that the censors have
power to punish by fine and imprisonment; and how they
exercise that authority we do not enquire, as it will be
apparent afterwards in the answer to the first objection, and
which is the most material one. In answer to the first objection,
then, we say, First that the cause of the commitment
is not traversable. Secondly if it were traversable, it
is set forth with certainty enough. That the cause of commitment
is not traversable appears by the authority which
the censors have by the act of parliament; for by it they are
constituted judges of fact, what is a mal-administration (of
medicines) and what is not: and they are judges of record
for they have authority to impose fine and imprisonment;
and when a new authority is constituted, with power to fine
and imprison, the persons invested with such authority are
judges of record; for that every thing proves a court to be a
court of record, viz. the power of fining and imprisoning;
for courts which are not of record can neither set a fine nor
commit any one to prison. 8 Co. 38. b. And there it is
proved, that the leet can impose a fine, because it is a court
of record; and forasmuch as the statute W. 2. c. 11 impowers
the auditors to commit the accountant to prison the
auditors are thereby made judges of record; as is observed
10 Co. 103. a. 2. Inst. 218. Then the censors being constituted
judges of the matter, that which they have done as
such they shall not be answerable for; and that a judge shall
not be answerable for an act done by him as a judge, appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_123'>a_123</span>by 12 Co. 24. and the cases there cited. True it is,
that if a justice of(<i>a</i>) peace issue his warrant to imprison
the party, or to arrest him until such time as he can be
brought before him, or if the commissioners of bankrupts
commit a witness for refusing to be examined(<i>a</i>) it may
be determined in an action, whether they have pursued their
authority or not; for their act in this respect is only ministerial;(<i>b</i>)
and the commitment is not intended as a punishment,
but only as a mesne process to bring the party to
justice, or to make him do his duty. My Lord Coke, it is
true, says in Dr. Bonham’s case, 8 Co. 121 a. that the cause
of commitment was traversable; but this opinion was there
given obiter, and was not essential to the case in judgment;
for there the question was, for practising without the licence
of the college, for which the party could not be imprisoned;
and Dr. Bonham being a graduate in the university,
my Lord Coke was carried away by his affection to his Alma
Mater so far as to make a resolution in the present point,
which was not in the case before him: but my Lord Coke
says, that upon a conviction by the censors, they ought to
make a record of it, which admits they are judges of record;
and then by his own rule there in the case of a justice of
peace who made a conviction of a force, and the cases in
his other works, their acts (the acts of the justices of the
peace) cannot be traversed; and my Lord Coke does not
cite any authority in support of his opinion (as to the point
now before us). The reason which he gives why the party
has no remedy by writ of error or otherwise is of no weight:
I grant that a writ of error lies not; for the censors having
a new authority by a special act of parliament and their
proceedings being directed to be in a summary way there
is no need for them to pursue the forms and methods of
others courts; and it is sufficient for them to make such
summary proceeding as justices of the peace in many cases
may do; yet the party is not without remedy for he may
have a Certiorari to remove the record of conviction, and
then it may be examined and reviewed, to see whether it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_124'>a_124</span>pursuant to their authority; for in every case where a new
jurisdiction is set up for a special purpose this court by
virtue of its original power may award a Mandamus to make
them put their authority in execution, and a Certiorari
to look into their proceeding whether it be conformable to
their authority or not. Thus a Certiorari lies to remove an
indictment for felony before the justices of the peace (bro.
Eliz. 489. Long’s case) to remove orders before commissioners
of sewers, or by justices of the peace who have authority
to make conviction of a force in their presence, or for
deer-stealing, but although no Certiorari did lie (in the present
case) it is not consequential that the cause of their
commitment is traversable; for if the parliament intrusts
them with a power so great that no act of theirs shall be
reversed or reviewed, there is the less reason that their
proceeding should be examined or traversed in an action;
a jury is not finable for giving a verdict against evidence;
and though there are many cases where jurymen have been
fined (1) yet Bushel’s case, in which all the others are
cited, is sufficient to controul all the rest. Vauq. 135 (a)
and if a juror shall not be fined or imprisoned or otherwise
punished for refusing to find a man guilty upon apparent
and plain evidence, much less shall a judge be liable to
censure. In the case (b) of Hammond and Powell, P. 29
Car. 2 an action for false-imprisonment was brought after
the resolution in Bushel’s case for his imprisonment (for
Hammond was one of the same jury with Bushel and fined
40l. and imprisoned for it at the same time,) and notwithstanding
that the fine and imprisonment were illegal yet it
was adjudged that the action did not lie for false-imprisonment
against the judge or the officer; so a fine imposed by a
judge of a court is not traversable as an amercement is.
7 H. 6. 13. a. As to the case between Terry and Huntington
Hard. 480 which may be objected; that is good law;
for there an action was brought against the commissioners
of excise, who had charged a man for the duty upon strong
waters, where the liquor made by him was low wine of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_125'>a_125</span>first extraction, and the action well lay, for they had exceeded
their jurisdiction; for low wines of the first extraction
were not chargeable within the act of parliament;
and if they had charged a duty upon a liquor not chargeable
with it, they were not to be excused for having named it
strong waters. If a justice of the peace commits a man for
being the Father of a bastard child no action lies against the
justice if the man was the father of a bastard otherwise if he
had no bastard at all. So the case between Nickols and
Walker, Cro. Car. 394, (<i>a</i>) is good law, for there an inhabitant
of Tottridge was charged to the poor of Hatfield;
and the justices of the peace have power to award a distress,
where a person is assessed to the poor of the parish where he
hath land or is an inhabitant; but where he is charged to
the relief of another parish there the case is beyond their
jurisdiction. But if the cause of the commitment were traversable
yet the plea of the defendants here is good, for it
shews with certainty in what the ill-administration of the
physic consisted viz in the use of unwholesome drugs: and
although it is not said what drugs he used, it is no matter,
for how shall we be informed whether he has shewn them.
In an action against a surgeon for an inartificial cure the
plaintiff does not shew what plaisters the defendant used.
As to what hath been said that the plea does not shew for
what malady the medicines were given; it was answered
that it would be so much the worse if the medicines were
given when the party had not any malady at all. And although
it is not said that the witnesses upon whose testimony
the fine was imposed were upon oath, yet the plea is sufficient;
for it may be that it was not necessary that they
should be sworn or if it were needful the omission of it is
not such as will make their proceedings void. In such a
special jurisdiction in which the proceeding is to be in a
summary manner it is not needful to observe all the circumstances
which are necessary in other legal proceedings.—Judgment
for the defendants.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The Question was, whether a Man, that had taken

might not practise in London, and within seven miles
of the same, without a Licence from the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court clear of Opinion, that a Licence from the
College was necessary; and that by reason of the Charter
of Incorporation, confirmed by 14 &amp; 15 Hen. 8. cap. 5.
penn’d in very strong and negative words.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Testimonials granted by the Universities upon
a Person’s taking the Doctors Degree; the Court was of
Opinion, That these Testimonials might have the Nature of
a Recommendation; they might give a Man a fair Reputation,
but conferr’d no Right; and consequently all those
Statutes, which have confirmed the Privileges of the Universities,
could revive or confirm nothing but the Reputation,
that this Testimonial might give such Graduates.</p>

<p class='c000'>And whereas it has been insisted, That by the last Clause
of the Statute, it is said, That none shall practise in the

it was said all the inference from that would be, That possibly
two Licences may be necessary where a person is not a

which were confirmed by stat. 14 and 15 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 5.

<p class='c000'>The plaintiff, who was an apothecary, and freeman of
<i>London</i>, attended one <i>Seale</i>, a butcher, in the parish of
<i>Saint Martin in the Fields</i>, and made up and administered
proper medicines to him; but, without any licence from
the faculty, and also without the direction of any physician,
and without taking or demanding any fee for his advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The defendants apprehending this conduct to be an infringement
of their privileges, brought their action against
the plaintiff, to recover the penalty of 5<i>l.</i> <i>per</i> month, under
the above clause in their charter; and, on the trial, the
jury found a special verdict, stating the charter, the confirmatory
statute, and the facts of the case; and submitted
to the Court, whether the defendant <i>Rose</i> did practice
physic, within the intent of the letters patent and act of Parliament.—And,
after this verdict had been three several
times argued in the Court of Queen’s Bench, the Judges
were unanimously of opinion, that <em>the facts found did amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_128'>a_128</span>to the practising physic, within the meaning of the act of
Parliament</em>; and gave judgment accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hereupon, a writ of error in Parliament, was brought to
reverse this judgment; and on behalf of the Plaintiff in error,
it was argued, that the consequences of it would not only
ruin him, but all other apothecaries; as, in case of the
affirmance of this judgment, they could not exercise their
profession, without the licence of a physician. That the
constant usage and practice, which had always been with
the apothecary, was conceived to be the best expounder of
this charter; and, that therefore, the selling a few lozenges,
or a small electuary, to any person asking a remedy for a
cold, or in other ordinary or common cases, where the medicines
had a known and certain effect, could not be deemed
unlawful; or practising as a physician, when no fee was
taken or demanded for the same. That the physicians by
straining an act made so long ago, endeavoured to monopolize
all manner of physic solely to themselves; and if
they should succeed in this attempt, it would be attended
with many mischievous consequences: For, in the first
place, it would be laying a heavy tax on the nobility
and gentry, who, in the slightest cases, and even for their
common servants, could not have any kind of medicine,
without consulting and giving a fee, to a member of the
college: It would also be a great oppression upon poor
families, who, not being able to bear the charge of a fee,
would be deprived of all kind of assistance in their necessities:
And, it would prove extremely prejudicial to all sick
persons, who, in case of sudden accidents, or new symptoms,
happening in the night-time, generally send for the apothecary;
but who should not dare to apply the least remedy,
without running the hazard of being ruined.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other side, it was contended, that by several
orders of the college, its members were enjoined to give
their advice to the poor <i>gratis</i>; and that not only to such
as could come to them for it; but every physician, in his
neighbourhood, was obliged to visit the sick poor, at their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_129'>a_129</span>own lodgings; and therefore the objection, that, if the apothecaries
could not administer physic but by the prescript
of a physician, the poorer sort of people would be lost for
want of proper remedies, had not the least foundation.
And, when these orders were observed not to have their full
intended effect, on account of the high prices which the
apothecaries generally demanded for the remedies prescribed,
whereby the poor were deterred from consulting the physician,
for fear of the charge of the physic; the college, by a
joint stock, erected several dispensaries in town, where,
after the physicians had given their advice <i>gratis</i>, the patients
might have the physic prescribed, for a third, and
generally less, of what the apothecaries used to exact for it;
by which expedient, many hundred persons of mean condition,
received their cures at a very small expense, and
without one farthing profit arising to the physicians. That
in cases of sudden and immediate necessity, not only apothecaries,
but any other person, might do his best to relieve
his neighbour, without incurring the penalty of the law;
but there was no reason why the apothecaries, under that
pretence, should be permitted to undertake, at leisure, all
dangerous diseases; and especially where, as in this city at
least, a skilful physician may be as soon had as an apothecary.
That, in common or trifling indispositions, the patients
themselves were generally their own physicians; and
would of course, send for any medicine, of which there
had been common experience, for their cure, and which the
apothecary might lawfully make up and sell; but, for the
apothecary to be permitted to judge of diseases in their beginning,
whether slight or not, and to order medicines for
the same, would prove both dangerous, and more chargeable.
<i>Dangerous</i>, because the most malignant distempers
usually begin with apparently inconsiderable symptoms,
and are many days before they appear in their proper colours;
and, as apothecaries are not bred to have suitable
skill, the management thereof ought not to be left to their
judgment. And <em>more chargeable</em>, because, be the disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_130'>a_130</span>ever so slight, the apothecary will be sure to prescribe largely
enough; and should he chance to mistake, then that distemper,
which, by the discreet advice of a physician, might,
by one proper medicine, have been eradicated at the beginning,
runs out into great length, to the extreme hazard
and great expense of the patient.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span>, after hearing counsel on this writ of error, it was

<p class='c000'>Doctor Stanger, after referring to the above statutes
(3 Hen. 8: 14 &amp; 15 Hen. 8) and Charter, stated in his
affidavit that in 1783 he took a degree of doctor of physic
at <i>Edinburgh</i> after a residence there for three years, and
after having studied physic there and at other places for
many years; that afterwards he went abroad to <i>France</i>,
<i>Italy</i>, and <i>Germany</i>, and studied physic there for several
years more. That in 1789 he obtained a licence from the
college of physicians here in the usual way to practise in
<i>London</i> and within seven miles thereof, and that he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_131'>a_131</span>practised ever since. That in <i>June</i> 1796 he applied to the
president and college at their general meeting to be admitted
by them to be a member of their corporation, submitting
himself to be previously examined by them concerning
his qualification and fitness to be admitted a member of
the corporation, which the college refused. Dr. <i>Stanger</i>
also added in his affidavit that he was duly qualified and fit
to be admitted a member of the college.</p>

<p class='c000'>The affidavits in answer to the rule disclosed the following
(among other) facts. For two hundred years past there
have been three classes of persons practising physic in <i>London</i>
and seven miles round; the fellows; candidates, persons
desirous of becoming members and who have been examined
and approved by the president and censors to be
candidates for election into the society or fellowship; and
the licentiates, who may practise as fully in all respects as
fellows and have the same benefits and advantages. Various
bye-laws have been made by the college respecting the
qualifications of persons to be admitted fellows, one of them
so long ago as 1637, by which it was ordained that no person
should be admitted a fellow unless he had performed
all his exercises and disputations in one of our universities
without dispensation, and which has continued ever since
with some little alterations. To prevent any mistakes arising
from the words “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquâ Britanniæ Academiâ</span></i>” in some of
the bye-laws respecting this qualification, an explanatory
bye-law was made in 1751, in which it was declared that
the meaning of the words was that no person should be admitted
who was not a Doctor of Physic of <i>Oxford</i> or <i>Cambridge</i>.
The bye-laws of the college have been revised and
altered since the year 1768. By those now in existence no
person can be admitted a fellow unless he has been a candidate
for a year, except in certain cases hereafter mentioned.
No person can be admitted into the class of candidates unless
he has been created a Doctor of Physic in the university
of <i>Oxford</i> or <i>Cambridge</i>, or unless he has obtained the
same degree in the university of <i>Dublin</i> and has been incorporated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_132'>a_132</span>into one of the universities of <i>Oxford</i> or <i>Cambridge</i>;
nor can any such person be admitted into the class of candidates
until after he has been examined as to his knowledge
of physic in three of the greater or lesser meetings (called
the <i>comitia majora</i> and <i>comitia minora</i>) of the college.
After a person has been a candidate for a year, he may be
proposed by the president at one of the greater meetings
and admitted a fellow, if the majority of fellows consent,
without further examination. But by two other bye-laws
persons not having the above qualifications may be proposed
in one of two ways; by one, the president is enabled once
in every other year at the <i>comitia minora</i> to propose one
licentiate of ten years standing, who may (if the major part
of the <i>comitia minora</i> consent) be proposed by the president
at the next <i>comitia majora</i> to be elected a fellow, and
if the majority of fellows then present consent, he may
then be admitted a fellow. By the other, any one of the
fellows may propose any licentiate, of seven years standing
and of the age of 36, in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia majora</span></i> to be examined;
if the major part of the fellows consent, such licentiate may
be examined by the president or vice-president and censors,
and if approved by the major part of the fellows then present,
he may be proposed at the next <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia majora</span></i> to be
a fellow, and admitted if the majority of the fellows then
present consent. The ordinary greater meetings (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia
majora</span></i>) are holden four times a year, and consist of the
president or vice-president and ten fellows at the least. The
ordinary lesser meetings (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia minora</span></i>) consisting of the
president or vice-president registar and censors of the college,
are holden once a month. A letter was also inserted
in the affidavits written by King <i>Charles</i> the Second to the
college not to admit any person who had not had his education
in either of our universities of <i>Oxford</i> or <i>Cambridge</i>:
but it was admitted in the argument that no notice could
legally be taken of this letter. It was also stated in the
affidavits that Dr. <i>Stanger</i>, when he was licensed; gave his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_133'>a_133</span>faith or promise to the college that he would observe the
statutes of the college &amp;c. in the usual mode.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Adair Serjt. Law</i>, <i>Chambre</i>, and <i>Christian</i>, argued in
support of the rule; and</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Erskine</i>, <i>Gibbs</i>, <i>Dampier</i>, and <i>Warren</i>, against it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The case was argued very much at length on three several
days: but it is unnecessary to give a detail of the arguments,
as the Court in giving their opinions went into them.
The points insisted upon by the counsel in support of the
rule were these; 1st. That under the general words of the
charter “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes homines ejusdem facultatis</span></i>” &amp;c. Dr.
<i>Stanger</i>, who came within that description by his license,
had an inchoate right, which authorised him to tender himself
to the college for examination in order that he might
be admitted, if on examination the president and college
thought him qualified; though they admitted that the president
and college were the sole judges of his fitness. And
they referred to the several dicta of Lord <i>Mansfield</i> and
<i>Aston</i> J. in <i>R.</i> v. Dr. <i>Askew</i> and others, 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2169;
2202; 2193; 2202. Secondly, That the bye-laws requiring
an education at either of our universities or at <i>Dublin</i>
were illegal and void, on grounds of public policy, and also
on the ground that they superadded a qualification not required
by the Charter, 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2198, 9; 2203, 4; and that
it narrowed the number of the eligible; <i>R.</i> v. <i>Spencer</i>, 3
<i>Burr.</i> 1827; and <i>R.</i> v. <i>Cutbush</i>, 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2204.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand it was insisted, 1st. That Dr. <i>Stanger</i>
had no <em>right</em> to be examined in order to be a fellow, either
as a licentiate, Dr. <i>Archer</i>’s case, 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2203; or as
coming within the description “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes homines ejusdem
facultatis</span></i>” &amp;c.; but that the election into that body was a
mere matter of grant or favor, for that the charter evidently
marked out two descriptions of persons, the members of the
college (the fellows) and all those who practised physic in
<i>London</i> or within seven miles thereof, that the former were
to superintend the latter; and that if the latter had also a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_134'>a_134</span>right to be admitted fellows the distinction between the
governors and the governed would be destroyed, and the
very object of the charter and act of parliament, in giving
to the fellows the superintendance of the others practising
physic in and about <i>London</i>, would be defeated;—observing
that the usage for a long period was in favour of this construction.
2dly, That Dr. <i>Stanger</i>, by giving his faith
when he received his licence in 1789, was estopped to object
to the bye-laws. But this point was abandoned in the course
of the argument; it being considered that he was only bound
to observe the bye-laws of the college that were not illegal.
3dly, That the bye-laws were neither against sound policy
or law; and instances were alluded to of degrees taken in
either of our universities giving privileges to the persons
taking them in the other professions. And the counsel observed
that the not having taken a degree in one of our universities
was not an absolute bar to any person becoming a
fellow of the college, there being two modes by which he
might gain admission without that qualification.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord <span class='sc'>Kenyon</span>, Ch. J. If in deciding this question it
were necessary for us to answer all the arguments that have
been urged at the bar, I should have desired further time to
consider of the subject; but as the grounds on which I am
warranted to determine the case lie in a very narrow compass,
and I have formed my opinion upon it, I wish to put
the question at rest now. By what fatality it has happened
that almost ever since this charter was granted this learned
body have been in a state of litigation I know not; and I
cannot but lament that the learned Judges in deciding the
cases reported in <i>Burrow</i> did not confine themselves to the
points immediately before them, and dropped hints that perhaps
have invited litigation; though indeed I cannot see what
these parties are contending for that is worth the expense
and anxiety attending this litigation. The public already
have the benefit of the assistance of the licentiates; and
their emoluments, the fair fruits of their education and advice,
are just the same as those that the fellows of the college
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_135'>a_135</span>receive. We have however been pressed with the authority
of those who have preceded us here: no person can have a
greater veneration for those characters than I have, and if
this point had been decided by them, I should have thought
myself bound by their decision. But the cases are unlike.
The principal ground on which it was said in 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2199.
that the bye-laws of the college were bad was, that “they
interfered with their exercising their own judgment,
and prevented them from receiving into their body persons
known or thought by them to be really fit and qualified;”
and if I had found that objection existed in this case, I
should have thought it fatal: but in the very sentence in
which Lord <i>Mansfield</i> expressed himself as above, he added
“such of them indeed as only require a proper education
and a sufficient degree of skill and qualification may be still
retained.” Two universities have been founded in this
country, amply endowed and furnished with professors in
the different sciences; and I should be sorry that those who
have been educated at either of them should undervalue the
benefits of such an education.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this case it is admitted that a licentiate does not <i>de
facto</i> become a fellow of the college: it is admitted that he
must be first examined, and that those who are called the
College of Physicians are to judge of his fitness. It seems
that the appeal here is rather made <i>ad verecundiam</i>, and
that Dr. <i>Stanger</i> could not be rejected if he were examined.
If the college are not judges of the fitness of the person examined,
I do not know who is. Then is this a reasonable
test of the fitness of the party? possibly they might have
framed a better, though I do not say that they could; but
the question here is whether this is a reasonable bye-law?
According to the concurrent opinions of all mankind it is.
The Legislature have considered that persons who have taken
their degrees in our universities are entitled to certain privileges
in the church. So if we look into our own profession,
those who have been educated at our universities have
particular privileges; and though the inns of court are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_136'>a_136</span>corporations, yet their regulations shew that this has been
considered as reasonable. It is not that a person becomes
qualified from keeping his commons within the walls of the
inns of court or the universities, but living with those of the
profession will probably advance him in the knowledge of
that profession for which he is a candidate. Again in the
civil law; however competent any particular individual
may be from extraordinary endowments or the exertion of
superior talents, he must first take his degrees at one of our
universities, and afterwards continue a year in a state of
probation before he can practise. Those regulations that are
adapted to the common race of men are the best: it does
not follow that all institutions calculated for the ordinary
classes are to be prostrated merely because they stand in the
way of some few individuals of superior talents. Then the
question is whether this is a reasonable bye-law that requires
a degree to be taken at one of our universities, which
in general is supposed to be conferred as a reward for
talents and learning. If indeed this had been a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua
non</span></i>, and it had operated as a total exclusion of every other
mode of gaining access to the college, it would have been a
bad bye-law: but these bye-laws point out other modes of
gaining admission into the college. If Dr. <i>Stanger</i> has all
those requisites that qualify a person for that high station,
any one of the fellows may now propose him; he may apply
to the honourable feelings of the college, to the very
same tribunal to which this mandamus (if it were granted)
would refer him; for in all events he must submit to their
examination and determination. In the profession of the
church, we find that the bishops insist on having a testimonial
of the person to be ordained signed by a certain number
of clergymen; and though the bishops themselves may have
the power of judging of the fitness of the person to be ordained
it was never doubted but that this was one reasonable
test of fitness, even before examination: it is a test to regulate
their own conduct. So here I think this is a reasonable
test. Therefore on this short ground, without entering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_137'>a_137</span>into any of the other topics that have been argued, I am of
opinion that these are good and reasonable bye-laws, and
that we are bound to refuse the writ.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ashhurst, J.</span> Though this matter has taken a considerable
time in the argument, it is now reduced to a narrow
compass. The counsel who have argued for the issuing of
the mandamus do not contend that a licentiate, as such,
does <i>ipso facto</i> become a member or a fellow of the college:
they only say that any man who is fit in learning and morals
has a right to offer himself for examination, without any superadded
qualification; and therefore that the bye-law requiring
“that every licentiate, in order to entitle him to offer himself
for examination, shall be a doctor of one of the two <a id='uni'></a>universities
in <i>England</i> or that of <i>Dublin</i>,” is a void bye-law. It
is not denied by counsel who have argued for the rule that
the corporation have the right of making bye-laws for the
regulation of their own body. And Lord <i>Mansfield</i>, on
whose authority they ground themselves as in their favour,
said in 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2199, “that such bye-laws as only require a
proper education and a sufficient degree of skill and qualification
may be still retained; that there can be no objection
to cautions of this sort; and the rather if it be true
that there are some amongst the licentiates unfit to be received
into any society.” This brings it then to the
question, whether the bye-law now under discussion is or is
not to be considered as a bye-law of regulation. It does
appear to me that in order to ensure a proper education and
a competence in a learning, there cannot be a more likely
method than the having spent fourteen years in one of our
learned universities, and, after having been examined by
persons competent to the subject, having been admitted to
a doctor’s degree. This it should seem would prevent in
<i>limine</i> the danger of that happening, which Lord <i>Mansfield</i>
complains of, namely, of persons being admitted amongst
the licentiates unfit to be received into that society. Indeed
the Legislature so long ago as the passing of the act of the
14 and 15 <i>Henry</i> 8. seemed to shew their own opinion how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_138'>a_138</span>much stress ought to be laid on such a kind of test; for
there, in speaking of country physicians, the act says,
“that no person shall be suffered to exercise or practise in
physic through <i>England</i> until such time as he be examined
in <i>London</i> by the president and three elects, and have
from them letters testimonial of their approving and examination:”
but then the act goes on with this exception (viz.)
“unless he be a graduate of <i>Oxford</i> or <i>Cambridge</i>, which
hath accomplished all things for his form without any grace.”
This shews the opinion of the legislative body of that day;
and the college might think it a very fit model for their
imitation in the formation of the bye-law now under discussion,
and that it would prevent them from having their
time too much broken in upon by improper applications for
examination. I would not be thought to infer that the
gentleman now applying is in any degree deficient either in
learning or education: but general laws cannot give way to
particular cases; and as this law has been of some standing,
we must suppose it has been found to be attended with
general convenience, and therefore it should be abided by.
I therefore concur in the opinion that the rule for a mandamus
should be discharged.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Grose, J.</span> This being a motion for a mandamus to a
body incorporated by charter, we must see that we are authorised
by the charter or the bye-laws to grant the application.
On examining the charter, which was confirmed by
act of parliament, we find that there was a select body of
eight including the president, and an indefinite number of
the commonalty. The election of the president is to be
made annually by the college; so also is the election of the
four censors. The intention of the crown was to put an end
to the mischiefs occasioned by the ignorance of the unskilful
practitioners; and for that purpose this corporation was
created, with power of making bye-laws, of admitting skilful
persons to practise physic, and of preventing all others
practising: the great object was to admit only those to
practise physic who were (to use the language of the act)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_139'>a_139</span>“profound sad and discreet, groundedly learned and deeply
studied in physic.” How or when the fellows are to be
chosen or admitted is not directed by the charter: it is left
to the discretion of the persons named in the charter under
the general power given to them of perpetuating themselves
and of making bye-laws. The charter is therefore silent
both as to the election of fellows, and as to the examination
of them before election: but the examination is incident to
the power of election. The charter being silent on these
heads, and the college having the power of making bye-laws,
they have made bye-laws to ascertain a criterion of
fitness of future candidates, by pointing out in some cases
the mode of their education, in others the persons by whom
they were to be proposed as candidates. One of these bye-laws
is objected to as illegal, because it requires a degree to
be taken at one of our universities, which (it is contended)
is superadding a qualification to those required by the charter:
but I think it is only ascertaining a criterion of fitness
as has been done most properly in other professions in cases
alluded to both at the bar and bench. Then it is said that
a licenciate has an inchoate right: if by that Dr. <i>Stanger’s</i>
counsel mean that he has one qualification which when
added to others may give him a right of admission, I agree
with them; but the college are to judge of the other qualifications:
if by this inchoate right they mean any thing
more, I dissent from them. It is admitted by this application
that the college have a right to insist on an examination:
and upon what ground? as a test of fitness—but though
this right is not expressly given to them by the charter, nor
is there a word denoting any obligation either to admit or
examine, it is incident to their power of judging who is fit
to be admitted. That Lord <i>Mansfield</i> thought that they
have such a right incidently is clear from what fell from him
in Dr. <i>Askew’s</i> case, in which he said, “It is true that the
judgment and discretion of determining upon this skill
ability learning and sufficiency to exercise and practise this
profession is trusted to the college of physicians: and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_140'>a_140</span>Court will not take it from them in the due and proper
exercise of it.” The same power that authorises them to
judge of fitness also authorises them to regulate the mode
by which they shall judge. They think, of which they are
much better judges than we can be, that every man who is
to be a candidate ought either to have taken his degree at
one of our universities or in Dublin, or shall be proposed by
one fellow, or by the president. The bye-laws requiring
this do not appear to me unreasonable or inconsistent with
the character any more than requiring a particular mode of
education, and in the case so often alluded to Lord <i>Mansfield</i>
thought such bye-laws were good; for when he recommended
it to the college to revise their bye-laws, he said
“Such of them indeed as only required a proper education
and a sufficient degree of skill and qualification may be still
retained.” In consequence of that opinion the college have
reviewed and altered their bye-laws, requiring in some
cases an education at either of our universities or at <i>Dublin</i>,
in others permitting a nomination of persons as fit to be
examined by men whom they deem worthy of such a trust,
considering such degree and nomination merely as tests of
the person taking it or named having skill and learning and
being fit to be examined. And in making these bye-laws I
think that the college have shewn a due attention to discharge
their duty to the public and to attain the ends of
their institution. Therefore I concur in the opinion already
given that this rule ought to be discharged.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Lawrence, J.</span> This is an application for a mandamus to
compel the College of Physicians to examine Dr. <i>Stanger</i> in
order that he may be admitted a fellow; and the foundation
of the application is that he has been admitted to the practise
of physic and is one of the <i>homines facultatis</i> within the
meaning of the charter; which (it is said) gives him a right
to admission, if on examination he shall be found fit; and
that all the bye-laws militating against such right are illegal.
His counsel have been under the necessity of insisting on
the licence giving him a right to examination; for if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_141'>a_141</span>being admitted a member of the body be matter of election,
it is immaterial whether the bye-laws be good or bad. It
seems to me that the insufficiency of the provisions of the
statute 3 <i>Hen.</i> 8. probably gave rise to this charter; the
object of which was to establish a better mode of determining
who were proper persons to be licensed to practise
physic, and to prevent the practice of ignorant empirics;
and if so, it was not necessary that all men of the faculty
should be members of the body. All that was necessary
was that it should be composed of a sufficient number of
learned and discrete practisers of physic, who should have
a power of continuing the succession in such persons as
themselves, and that they should license proper persons and
restrain unfit persons from the practice of it. If this were
the object, is it natural to construe the charter as giving a
right to all men of the faculty to become members of this
body, when the charter speaks of men of the faculty in a
sense contradistinguished from the members of the body; or
to suppose that the Crown meant to incorporate all, when
the charter was made for the government of some, who, if
all were incorporated, could not exist? It is admitted that
there were two distinct classes under the charter, and according
to Dr. <i>Stanger’s</i> construction one class, that of the
governed, would be extinguished. Another mode of construing
the charter in the argument was by considering the
words <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes homines ejudem facultatis</span></i> to mean the individual
members of the corporation: but if so, there would
be no power given to make bye-laws to affect the licentiates;
and the clause in the charter that gives the exemption from
serving on juries speaks of the person exercising the faculty
as contradistinguished from the members of the college;
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nec presidens nec aliquis de collegio prædicto medicorum,
nec successores sui, nec eorum aliquis exercens facultatem
illam</span></i>.” Therefore it seems to me that the <i>homines facultatis</i>
are not the individual members of the college. Then it
was said that there might be some persons who might not
choose to become corporators, and that this would make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_142'>a_142</span>class to be governed: but that is improbable; it is not to be
supposed that, as the principal object of the charter was to
incorporate those who were skilled in physic and to prevent
those from practising who were unfit, they to whom the
charter was offered would refuse the advantages of this corporation,
especially as the obvious means of <a id='con'></a>constituting a
body to consist of all would be to make it compulsory on
the physicians to become members, as in the case with companies
in some city and corporate towns, of which persons
carrying on certain trades are obliged to be free. But seeing
that there is in some degree an uncertainty as to the words
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">homnes ejusdem facultatis</span></i>,” the usage that has prevailed
ought to govern us in the construction of them, especially as
the usage perfectly accords with the design of the incorporation.
It is said indeed that the usage is in favour of Dr.
<i>Stanger’s</i> claim: but that is not so; for there is no proof
that before these bye-laws were made any persons were
admitted into the body as a matter of right, and we must
therefore take it that they came in by election. If Dr.
<i>Stanger</i> claim as a matter of right, it must be under the
words of the charter “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod ipsi omnesque homines ejusdem
facultatis</span></i> &amp;c.” but if this gave him a right, the college
could not resist his claim though he would not submit to
examination. And if every <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo ejusdem facultatis</span></i> came
within this description of claim, Dr. <i>Archer</i> would have had
a right to be admitted. The charter does not say that all
the men of the faculty, who on examination shall be found
fit, shall be admitted; if it has said any thing in their favor,
it has given them the right as soon as they become men of
the faculty; it has directed no examination. Suppose by a
charter all the weavers of a town were incorporated, they
would all have a right to be admitted without any examination.
If then all the men of the faculty within the limited
district have a right from being men of the faculty, they
possess all the fitness that the charter requires. This seems
to me to be only a contrivance to get out of Dr. <i>Archer’s</i>
case, and to set up a right on the ground of being a licentiate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_143'>a_143</span>In the course of the argument it was said that only
those were to be admitted who were “profound sad and
discrete, groundedly learned and deeply studied in physic:”
but if so, it destroys the argument arising from the words
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes homines ejusdem facultatis</span></i>.” An argument has
also been drawn from the statute 3 <i>Hen.</i> 8:, and it has been
said that the persons licensed by that act were the only persons
who at the time of the charter were men of the faculty,
and that they and the six persons named were meant to be
incorporated. But the words of the charter do not extend
to all those persons; they are confined to the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">homines de
et in civitate prædictâ</span></i>,” that is, to all men of and in the
city of <i>London</i> practising physic: but this does not extend
to persons practising in other places. Now if that construction
had been adopted, it would have excluded the
greater part of those who have been members of the college
practising physic in <i>Oxford</i>, <i>Cambridge</i>, and other places
beyond these limits, as not falling within the description of
those persons of whom (according to the construction) the
college is to consist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking the whole of the charter and the usage this construction
will reconcile all the difficulties; the intention of
the Crown was to incorporate the six persons named in the
charter and all men practising physic at that time <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de et in
civitate prædictâ</span></i>; and all those persons were entitled to
admission: but the Crown did not intend to give any right
to those, who might thereafter become <i>homines facultatis</i>,
but intended that the succession should be continued by the
power incident to all corporations to elect. Had the charter
of incorporation nominated every man authorised to practise
physic in <i>London</i> and given no directions as to the succession,
they would have been authorised to continue themselves
by election as they have done; and the charter has
done the same thing in substance by incorporating the same
persons by a general reference to their character and situation.
This avoids all contradiction; it is consistent with the
usage; and according to this construction no one is entitled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_144'>a_144</span>as a matter of right but only by election. In making such
elections there is a trust and duty to keep up the body by a
choice of learned men sufficient to answer the purposes of
the charter; and if this be done all the interest that the
public have is consulted; they have no interest in this or
that man being a member of the college: so long as the body
is continued and there are proper censors elects and other
officers, and so long as proper persons are licensed and improper
ones restrained, the objects of the charter as far as
concerns the public will be attained. We have been pressed
however with the dicta of Lord <i>Mansfield</i> in <i>R.</i> v. Dr.
<i>Askew</i>; very great deference is always due to whatever fell
from him: but it <a id='is'></a>is sufficient to say that this was not the point
then before the Court, the only question there being whether
licentiates were of the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other question respecting the validity of the bye-laws,
I can hardly add to what has already been said by the
Court; and therefore shall only say that I agree with them
in thinking the bye-laws reasonable.</p>

<p class='c030'>My service and best respects remembered.</p>

<p class='c031'>Master President and my much honoured friend</p>

<p class='c023'>Whereas I am given to understand that you have heard that
the last year I would not give way to two or three for the
obtaining a Licence to practise Physick, nor to a Doctor of
Leyden to be incorporated with us without giving publick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_148'>a_148</span>testimony of his abilities, and I further understand that
yourself and the whole College are well pleased therewith,
I have cause to rejoice: and further thought fit at this time
to acquaint you with my real intentions, which I shall
eagerly prosecute, if I may have countenance and assistance.
I have observed and have grieved to see sometimes a Serving-man
sometimes an Apothecary oftentimes Masters of
Arts (whereof some have afterwards assumed holy Orders)
admitted to a Licence to practice in Physick, or to be incorporated
to a Degree without giving any publique testimony
of their <a id='lea'></a>learning and skill in the Profession. And
what hath followed hereupon? The Minister hath neglected
his own calling and trespassed upon another’s, not
without endangering the Souls of the people of God, and
the losse of the Lives of many of the King’s Subjects. The
Serving-man and Apothecary upon a Licence obtained have
been presently made Doctors by the breath of the people,
and Doctors indeed undervalued. Masters of Arts after
Licence obtained have taken as I said holy Orders, that if
one Profession did faile them another might supply them.
And Incorporation being in an instant obtained by a little
summe of money which by orderly proceeding (I speake
concerning the Doctor’s Degree) would cost 12 years study
in the University besides performance of exercises and much
expence; It is come to passe, that in the University at this
time I doe protest I doe not know any one that intends the
study of Physick, and practice thereof according to the
Statutes. Chirurgeons and Apothecaries are sought into, and
Physicians seldome but in a desperate case are consulted
with, when the Patient is ready to dye and in this kind we
have too many examples. The consideration of these mischiefs
redounding to the Church, Commonwealth, University,
and our Profession, hath often troubled me, when I
had no power to prevent them. But now seeing it hath
pleased God and the King to conferre such power upon me,
that without me neither Licence nor Degree in Physick can
be obtained at <i>Cambridge</i> (for I have solicited Dr. <i>Nichols</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_149'>a_149</span>and Dr. <i>Allet</i> to joyne with me; and I have prevailed soe
farre with them that they will doe nothing without me) I
doe intend by the grace of God to give way unto noe man
to obtain a Licence or Degree without keeping an Act at
the least, &amp;c. unless it shall happen that with some one
particular man it shall be dispenced withall by supreme
Authority or in some extraordinary case. But all this will
be to little purpose, unlesse yourselfe and the College will
solicite Dr. <i>Clayton</i>, his Majesties Professor at <i>Oxford</i>, and
others of the faculty there, to doe the like; or rather Petition
to my Lord’s Grace of <i>Canterbury</i>, who out of his innate
goodnesse, and zeale for the good of the Church and Commonwealth,
and the honour of the Universities, I am fully
perswaded, will grant what you desire, against Apothecaries
and Chirurgeons, and all others which without Licence and
authority do practise Physick, I could wish there were some
course taken; I know there be already good Lawes, if they
were put in execution. This much in haste (as you may
perceive by my writing) I thought good to signify unto you,
out of the grateful respect which I beare unto yourself and
the whole College, tending the honour of our common
Profession, which I will maintain as much as in me lyes,
and vindicate from the invasions of Usurpers and Intruders.
I have exceeded I feare the bounds of a Letter, but that
you will pardon I hope considering the occasion. And soe
with a gratefull acknowledgment of your love and favour
towards me and an ingenuous profession of much service I
owe unto you, I take my leave, as one that will be ready,
upon the least signification, to embrace your commands,

differences, and uncertainties in making or compounding
of medicines, if, for the future, the manner and form

others in their compositions of medicines: the Memorialist
therefore most humbly prays, that His Majesty will be graciously

this day took the said memorial into His Royal consideration,

of the general use of the said book may tend to the
prevention of such deceits in the making and compounding of

they may not pretend ignorance thereof, that the said book,
called <i>Pharmacopœia Collegii Regalis Medicorum Londinensis</i>,

<p class='c012'>This was a cause that stood in the Crown-Paper, upon a

<i>to have and take</i> <span class='sc'>Apprentices</span>, of the age of 14 years or

<i>Apprentices</i> have been used and accustomed to be <span class='fss'>ADMITTED</span>
<i>and</i> <span class='fss'>BOUND</span> <i>in the presence or with the consent of the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_154'>a_154</span><i>Richard Guy</i>, a Freeman of the said City, and also one of
the Freemen of the said Company of Surgeons of the said
City, being desirous of taking <i>Melmoth Guy</i>, his son, aged
15 years, to be his Apprentice for the Term of 7 years, to
be educated and instructed in the said Art, Science, or Mystery
of Surgery, had often offered the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i> to
be admitted and bound, before the said Master and Wardens
or some of them, his said Apprentice for the Term of
7 years, in the said Art, Science, or Mystery, according to
the said custom; and that the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i> had also
often offered himself to them or some of them, to be admitted

the said <i>Richard Guy</i> for the said Term, in the said Art,

had <em>not permitted</em> the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i> to be bound
Apprentice to the said <i>Richard Guy</i>, for the Term of 7
years, before them or any of them, but have altogether refused
and still refuse so to do; and commanding them, immediately

said <i>Melmoth Guy</i> to be <span class='fss'>ADMITTED</span> and <span class='fss'>BOUND</span>, before them
or some of them, <i>an Apprentice</i> to the said <i>Richard Guy</i>,
for the Term aforesaid, in the said Art, Science, or Mystery
according to the said custom, or signify cause to the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Return of the Master and Wardens admits the whole
of the custom and facts, to be as they are alledged in the
Writ. But they further certify and return, That long before
the said <i>Richard Guy</i> offered his said son <i>Melmoth</i>, or
the said <i>Melmoth</i> offered himself to them or any of them, to
be admitted and bound before them or any of them, an Apprentice
for the said Term of 7 years, in the said Art,

there, according to the Form of the Statute in that case
made and provided, make ordain constitute and establish a
certain <span class='sc'>Bye-Law</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Ordinance</span>, for the Regulation Government
and Advantage of the said Company of Surgeons,
in the words following. To wit, <i>Item</i>, It is <i>Ordained</i>
“That <i>no Member</i> of the said Company <i>shall take</i> any Person
into his Service, <i>as his Apprentice</i>, to be instructed
in the Art or Science of Surgery, for any shorter time than
7 years; <i>which person</i> <span class='fss'>SHALL UNDERSTAND</span> <i>the</i> <span class='sc'>Latin</span>
<i>Tongue</i>; his <span class='sc'>Ability</span> <i>wherein</i> shall, <span class='fss'>BEFORE</span> <i>his being

in order to being his Apprentice, <i>Present</i> such Person
before the Governors or two of them, <i>at a Court to be by

said Governors</i>, by Indenture; upon pain of forfeiting 20l.
of lawful money: And the Clerk of the said Company
<span class='fss'>SHALL NOT BIND</span> any Person who has <em>not</em> been so presented

lawful money and being liable to be removed from his said
Office. And no Apprentice shall be turned over from one
Master to another, but at a Court in the Presence of the
Master and Wardens or one of them: And One Guinea,
and no more, shall be paid for the same.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Which said <i>Ordinance</i> or <i>By-Law</i>, so made as aforesaid,
after the making thereof as aforesaid, and long before the
said <i>Richard Guy</i> had offered the said <i>Melmoth</i>, or the
said <i>Melmoth</i> had offered himself to be admitted and bound
before them or any of them, an Apprentice to the said
<i>Richard Guy</i>, for the Term of 7 years, in the said Art Science
or Mystery of Surgery, according to the Custom aforesaid,
to wit, on the 9th day of the same <i>April</i> in the said year of
our Lord 1748, was examined approved and allowed by the
Right Honourable <i>Philip</i> Lord <i>Hardwicke</i> the then Lord
Chancellor of <i>Great Britain</i>, and by Sir <i>William Lee</i> Knt.
the then Lord Chief Justice of His Majesty’s Court of King’s
Bench, and Sir <i>John Willes</i> Knt. the then Lord Chief
Justice of His Majesty’s Court of Common Bench, according
to the Form of the Statute in that Case made and provided.</p>

<p class='c000'>They further return That the said Ordinance or By-Law,
so made examined approved and allowed as aforesaid, hath
ever since the making examination approbation and allowance
thereof as aforesaid, been, and now is in full force and
effect, and in no wise annulled revoked and vacated.</p>

<p class='c000'>They then return That after the making examination approbation
and allowance of the said Ordinance or By-Law
as aforesaid, and before the Issuing of this Writ, to wit, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_157'>a_157</span>the 3d of <i>May</i> in the Year of our Lord 1759, at a certain
Court then holden at <i>Surgeons Hall</i> in the <i>Old Bailey London</i>,
by <i>Mark Hawkins</i> then Master, and <i>Christopher Fullagar</i>
and <i>Edward Nourse</i> then Governors of the said Company
of Surgeons, (They the said <i>Mark Hawkins</i>, <i>Christopher
Fullagar</i> and <i>Edward Nourse</i>, having before that
Time been duly elected chosen appointed and sworn into
their said respective Offices, according to the Form of the
Statute in that Case made and provided,) came the said
<i>Richard Guy</i> before the said Court, and offered and presented
his said Son <i>Melmoth</i>; And the said <i>Melmoth</i> did
then and there offer himself to the said Master and Governors
then being at that Court, to be admitted and bound,
before them, an Apprentice to the said <i>Richard Guy</i>, for
the Term of 7 years, in the said Art Science or Mystery of
Surgery; And that the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i>, being so offered
and presented as aforesaid, was then and there <em>examined</em>
touching his knowledge in the <i>Latin</i> tongue; And his ability
therein, <em>in Pursuance</em> of the Ordinance or By-Law
aforesaid, was then and there <em>fairly</em>, <em>candidly</em>, and <em>impartially</em>
<span class='fss'>TRIED</span> by the said <i>Edward Nourse</i>, he the said <i>Edward</i>
being then and there one of the Governors of the said
Company of Surgeons: And that the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i>,
<span class='fss'>UPON</span> <em>such his Examination</em>, and <em>upon his Ability</em> in the
<em>Latin Tongue</em> being so as aforesaid <em>tried</em> by the said <i>Edward
Nourse</i> (so being one of the Governors or Wardens of
the said Company as aforesaid) <em>was found</em>, <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <em>to understand</em>
the <i>Latin</i> Tongue, but to be <span class='fss'>WHOLLY IGNORANT</span> <em>thereof</em>;
and was then and there so <span class='fss'>ADJUDGED</span> <em>and declared</em> to be,
by the said <i>Edward Nourse</i>, on such Trial.—Wherefore
the said Court could not consent, but did then and there
refuse to permit the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i> to be admitted and
bound an Apprentice to the said <i>Richard Guy</i>, for the
Term of 7 years, in the said Art Science or Mystery of
Surgery, according to the Custom aforesaid, <span class='sc'>Until</span> such
Time as the said <em>Melmoth should understand</em> the <em>Latin</em>
Tongue, as by the aforesaid Ordinance or By-Law is in that
behalf required.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_158'>a_158</span>They further return expressly and positively, That the
said <i>Melmoth Guy</i>, when he was so presented and offered
as aforesaid, before the aforesaid Master and Governors or
Wardens of the said Company of Surgeons, at the said
Court, by them held for the purpose herein before in that
behalf mentioned, <span class='fss'>DID NOT</span> understand the <i>Latin</i> Tongue:
but <span class='fss'>WAS UTTERLY IGNORANT</span> of the same: And that the
said <i>Melmoth Guy</i> hath <span class='fss'>NOT</span>, at any Time before or since
his being so examined and tried as to his Ability in the <i>Latin</i>
Tongue as aforesaid, <em>offered himself or been presented</em> to
the said Company or Governors thereof, or any one of them
for the Time being, <em>to be tried</em> as to his ability in the <i>Latin</i>
Tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>And therefore they cannot permit the said <i>Melmoth Guy</i>
to be admitted and bound before them an Apprentice to the
said <i>Richard Guy</i> for the said Term of 7 years, in the said
Art Science or Mystery of Surgery, according to the Custom
aforesaid, as by the Writ they are commanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Field pro Rege</i> objected and argued “That this was
an <em>insufficient</em> Return:” For that the <i>By-Law</i> is a <em>bad</em>
one, being made in <em>Restraint of a natural general and common
Right</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>first</em> Restriction of the common Right that every
Person has of learning and exercising any Art in any Place,
except where it happens to be restrained by Custom, is the
Act of 5 <i>Eliz.</i> c. 4.</p>

<p class='c000'>The City of <i>London</i> have indeed, <em>by Custom</em>, a Power
over the Youth of their City, and a Power of excluding
Foreigners from exercising Trades within their City.</p>

<p class='c000'>11 <i>Rep.</i> 53. <i>Taylors of Ipswich Case</i>, shews the <em>general</em>
Law to be, that a person ought not to be restrained in his
lawful Mystery.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Private Companies</i> can not make Laws contrary to the
<i>General</i> Law or to the <i>Customs</i> of great Cities: though
great Cities and Towns may do so. This distinction is mentioned
in 6 <i>Mod.</i> 120.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a> <i>Cuddon</i> v. <i>Estwick</i>. And he cited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_159'>a_159</span>the Case of <i>the City of London</i> v. <i>Vanacker</i>, in 1 <i>Ld. Raym.</i>
496. where <i>Holt</i> Ch. J. said that “if the By-Law was for
the <i>Benefit of the City</i>, it would be good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This By-Law, therefore, is not good, without a particular
Custom to support it: for it <em>restrains a Common-Law
Right</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Return does not aver that the understanding the <i>Latin</i>
Tongue <em>is</em> a <em>necessary qualification</em> of a Surgeon: And their
Art may certainly be performed <em>without</em> it. At least, ’tis
no objection to a young Person’s being put out to <em>learn</em> the
Art; whatever it might be to the Admission of a Man to
<em>practise</em> it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides, “Understanding the <i>Latin</i> Tongue,” is a very
<em>indefinite</em> and <em>vague</em> expression: And a very different idea
of it would be conceived by different persons; as by <i>Dr.
Bentley</i> (for instance) and by a<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a> Warden of the Surgeons
Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bad consequences too, may arise from this By-Law:
And if so, it shall not prevail. <i>Godbolt</i> 254. S. C. with that
of <i>the Taylors of Ipswich</i>, (there called <i>The Cloth-workers
of Ipswich Case</i>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>If the <i>By-Law is bad</i>, this young man’s not understanding
<i>Latin</i> will <em>not cure or help</em> it. However, the By-Law
does <em>not expressly forbid</em> such a Person to be admitted: It
is <em>not mandatory</em>, but only <em>directory</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Serjeant <i>Hewit contra</i>, was rising up, to speak in
support of the Return,</p>

<p class='c000'>But Lord <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span> said it was too plain to argue.</p>

<h4 id='cert' class='c014'>Certificate of the College of Physicians concerning the Midwives of London.</h4>

<p class='c032'>May it please your Lordships,</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon consideration taken of this petition hereunto annexed,
presented unto the President and College of Physicians
by the Midwives, We, the College of Physicians,
conceiving the said complaint to be grounded upon just grievance,
and to conduce to a general good, in the timely prevention
of so growing an inconvenience, have particularly
informed ourselves concerning the said business, and do certify
that the like project was formerly attempted by another,
which is now intended by the doctour, and therefore was referred
by <i>K. James</i>, of blessed memory, to the Lords of
the Council, and by their Lordships to the College of Physicians,
to certify their opinion thereof; who upon mature
deliberation made report to their Lordships of the unfitness
of the said proposition, there being no such custom ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_163'>a_163</span>used either here or in any other kingdom, Wherefore the
same was rejected and died. And whereas we understand
that the said Doctour doth ground his complaint upon the
insufficiency of Midwives, whom he would undertake to
teach, though licensed by your Lordship’s officers, whom
we do believe to be as careful in admitting of Midwives as
they are in other kingdoms; only we are informed that divers
do practise without licence, and some are deputies to
others, through whom we probably conceive some abuses to
grow, because their abilities and honesty of lives and conversation
are not testified upon oath as others are who are licenced.
But for adding sufficiently to them by the Doctour’s
instruction, he is not otherwise able to instruct them
than any other the meanest Fellow of our College, unless
he understand it by the use of iron instruments, which Physicians
and Chirurgeons may practice if they please; and
some do and have done with as good success and dexterity
as himself, and therefore there is no necessity of a sole dependance
upon him. And it being true that is reported by
the Midwives, the Doctour doth often refuse to come to the
poor, they being not able to pay him according to his demands;
and for the rich he denies them his help until he
hath first bargained for great rewards; which besides that
they are in themselves dishonest, covetous, and unconscionable
courses, they are also contrary to the laws and
statutes of our College, to which by oath he is bound. We
therefore for this and other reasons we can alledge, conceive
his suit to be unreasonable and inconvenient. And so do
humbly leave the same to your Lordships’ grave judgments,
unto whom his Majesty referred the consideration thereof.</p>

  <h3 id='geo593' class='c011'>59 <i>Geo.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 41.<br /> <br />An Act to establish Regulations for preventing Contagious Diseases in <i>Ireland</i>. 14th <i>June</i> 1819.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Whereas it has become highly expedient to provide for
and secure constant attention to the health and comforts of
the inhabitants of <i>Ireland</i>, and for the prevention of contagious
disease, more especially in the cities and great towns
thereof; and that for that purpose officers of health should
be annually appointed in all cities and large towns, and that
such officers should also be appointed in such towns, parishes,
and villages in the country, as shall think it proper
or necessary to adopt such a measure; be it therefore enacted
by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by
the authority of the same, That within one calendar month
next after the passing of this Act, and within one calendar
month after the twenty-fifth day of <i>March</i> in the year one
thousand eight hundred and twenty, and in every subsequent
year, in every city and town in <i>Ireland</i>, which shall contain
one thousand inhabitants, or upwards; and in every
city and large town where the Lord Lieutenant, or other
Chief Governor or Governors of <i>Ireland</i>, shall think fit to
direct that this Act shall be carried into effect, the inhabitant
householders of each and every parish in such city or
town, assembled in vestry, shall and they are hereby required
to elect and appoint any number of persons not less
than two, and not more than five, to be officers of health
for such parish, for the year ending on the twenty-fifth day
of <i>March</i> next after such election, and until new officers of
health shall be in like manner appointed for such parish for
the year ensuing.</p>

<p class='c000'>II. And be it further enacted, That such officers of
health, so to be elected and appointed, shall act in the execution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_165'>a_165</span>of this Act without any salary, fee, or reward whatsoever;
and that the expenses to be incurred by such officers
in the execution of their Duties under this Act, not exceeding
such sums as shall be specified and determined on,
and limited and directed at the vestry to be assembled for
the choice of such officers, or at any subsequent vestry to be
called by the said officers, shall be raised and levied on the
inhabitants of such parish, in such manner and form as
other parochial assessments are raised and levied, and shall
by the said officers of health be applied to the purposes of
this Act; and the expenditure thereof shall be accounted
for by the said officers in such manner as other parochial
assessments are accounted for, and either at such times as
other assessments are accounted for according to law, or at
such other times and periods of the year, and as often from
time to time as shall be directed at the vestry to be assembled
for the appointment of such officers, or at any other
vestry to be called by two inhabitants of such parish; and
that copies of all such accounts shall once in every year, before
the twenty-fifth day of <i>April</i> in each year, be transmitted
by such officers of health to such public officer, or
office or place in <i>Dublin</i>, as shall be from time to time directed
by the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governor or
Governors of <i>Ireland</i> for the time being, or his or their
Chief Secretary.</p>

<p class='c000'>III. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be
lawful for the inhabitant householders of any parish, town,
or place whatever, in vestry assembled, in any part of <i>Ireland</i>,
to appoint such officers of health for such parish, in
case they shall think fit and expedient so to do; and to raise
such sum or sums of money, to be levied and accounted as
directed by this Act, in like manner as by this Act is required
to be done in cities and large towns as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c000'>IV. Provided always, and be it enacted, That no person
shall be compelled or compellable to act or serve as such
officer of health, in any parish or place, for any longer term
than one year, nor to act or serve as such officer for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_166'>a_166</span>year commencing within three years after the end of any
year for which he shall have served as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c000'>V. Provided also, and be it enacted, That it shall and
may be lawful for the inhabitant householders of any parish
in any county, city, town, or place in <i>Ireland</i>, to elect the
churchwardens of such parish for the time being to be officers
of health under this Act, in case they shall think fit so
to do; and it shall be lawful for such churchwardens, and
they are hereby authorized and required, to act as such
officers of health accordingly, under the present provisions
of this Act.</p>

<p class='c000'>VI. Provided also, and be it enacted, That where any
city or town as aforesaid, containing one thousand inhabitants,
or where the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor
or Governors of <i>Ireland</i> shall direct this Act to be carried
into execution, in case the inhabitant householders in any
parish or parishes in such city or town shall neglect or refuse
to elect and appoint such officers of health, within such
time as is required by this Act, or as shall be required
by any order of such Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief
Governor or Governors, it shall and may be lawful
for the Justices of the Peace assembled at the Quarter
Sessions, or any adjournment thereof, for the county, city,
or town within which such parish shall be situate, and the
said Justices are hereby authorized and required, to appoint
such officers of health in and for such parish, and also at the
same time to appoint and limit what sum shall be raised by
assessment on such parish for the purposes of this Act, and
such sum shall and may be raised and levied accordingly, in
like manner as any other parish assessments, and as if the
same had been authorised by the vestries of such parishes,
and shall be applied and accounted for in the manner herein
before directed.</p>

<p class='c000'>VII. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be
lawful for any one or more of the persons so to be appointed
officers of health, and he and they is and are hereby authorized,

house, as shall appear to any such officer of health to be indispensably
necessary for the preservation and security of
the inhabitants of such parish against the danger of contagion,
unless due precautions shall have previously been taken
for such purposes by the inhabitants of such house; and it
shall be lawful for all constables and peace officers, and they
are hereby authorized, empowered, and required, to be
aiding and assisting to such officers of health in the doing all
matters and things whatsoever in the execution of this Act.</p>

<p class='c000'>VIII. And be it further enacted, That in any parish or

and cleansing of the streets therein, and the collecting
and disposing of the dirt, dung, and filth of the said streets,
and also in any city or town whatever, where the scavengers
or other persons who shall be entrusted with or contract for

or omit to cleanse and sweep the streets and lanes of such
city or town, twice at least in every week, it shall and may

streets to be swept and cleansed, and the dirt, dung, and
filth collected from the same to be sold and disposed of, and

<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_168'>a_168</span>Act, and in diminution of the charge on the parish for which
such officers shall be appointed: provided always, that in
all cases where the Magistrates or Corporation of any city or
town have or shall have power and authority to regulate the
sweeping or cleansing of the streets, or where any scavenger
or other person shall be appointed or shall have contracted
for that purpose, the said officers of health shall give twenty-four
hours notice to the chief magistrate of such city or town,
and to the scavenger or other person contracting for the
cleansing of such streets, of the neglect or omission to sweep

<p class='c012'>Whereas, many great and dangerous abuses frequently
arise from the present state of Houses kept for the
reception of Lunaticks, for want of regulations with respect
to the persons keeping such houses, the admission of Patients
into them, and the Visitation by proper persons of the said
Houses and Patients: And whereas the law, as it now
stands, is insufficient for preventing or discovering such
abuses; may it therefore please your Majesty that it may
be enacted; and be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same, That,

or any other person concerned in confining any of his
Majesty’s subjects therein, any new justification from their
being able to prove that the persons so confined have been

appear to be so done, or that such Action or Suit shall be
brought in any other county, city, or place, or shall not have
been commenced within the time before limited for bringing
the same; that then the jury shall find a verdict for the defendant

<h3 id='plague' class='c011'>REPORT.<br /> <br />The Select Committee appointed to consider the validity of the doctrine of Contagion in the Plague; and to report their observations thereupon, together with the Minutes of the Evidence taken before the House: Have considered the matters to them preferred, and have agreed upon the following Report.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Your Committee being appointed to consider the validity
of the received doctrines concerning the nature of contagious
and infectious diseases, as distinguished from other epidemics,
have proceeded to examine a number of medical
gentlemen, whose practical experience or general knowledge
of the subject appeared to your Committee most likely
to furnish the means of acquiring the most satisfactory information.
They have also had the evidence of a number
of persons whose residence in infected countries, or whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_186'>a_186</span>commercial or official employments enabled them to communicate
information as to facts, and on the principle and efficacy
of the laws of Quarantine; all the opinions of the medical
men whom your Committee have examined, with the
exception of two, are in favour of the received doctrine, that
the Plague is a disease communicable by contact only, and
different in that respect from Epidemic fever; nor do your
Committee see any thing in the rest of the evidence they
have collected, which would induce them to dissent from
that opinion. It appears from some of the evidence, that
the extension and virulence of the disorder is considerably
modified by atmospheric influence; and a doubt has prevailed
whether under any circumstance, the disease could
be received and propagated in the climate of Great Britain.
No fact whatever has been stated to show, that any instance
of the disorder has occurred, or that it has ever been known
to have been brought into the Lazarettos for many years:
but your Committee do not think themselves warranted to
infer from thence, that the disease cannot exist in England;
because in the first place, a disease resembling, in most respects,
the Plague, is well known to have prevailed here in
many periods of our history, particularly in 1665-6: and
further, it appears that in many places, and in climates of
various nature, the Plague has prevailed after intervals of
very considerable duration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your Committee would also observe, down to the year 1800,
Regulations were adopted, which must have had the effect
of preventing goods infected with the Plague from being
shipped directly for Britain; and they abstain from giving
any opinion on the nature and application of the Quarantine
regulations, as not falling within the scope of enquiry to
which they have been directed; but they see no reason to
question the validity of the principles upon which such regulations
appear to have been adopted.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The plaintiff, who was a physician living at <i>Doncaster</i>,
brought this action for fees, for attending a considerable
time on the defendant’s testator, who lived at some little
distance from the town; and the evidence was, that at <i>Doncaster</i>
and its neighbourhood there was no certain rule about
fees, but the general practice was for a physician to receive
two guineas a week for his attendance. The plaintiff obtained
a verdict at the last assizes at <i>York</i>; to set aside
which <i>Wood</i> obtained a rule <i>nisi</i> last term, on the ground
that no action lay for a physician’s fees any more than for a
barristers.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Cockell</i>, Serj. and <i>Chambre</i>, now shewed cause; observing
that though this point had been ruled several times at
<i>nisi prius</i> against such a claim, yet it had never been solemnly
decided, nor was there any authority in the books
for putting the claim of a physician’s fees upon the same
footing as those of a barrister. In the latter case it might
originally have been proper that no temptation should be
held out to countenance injustice: but in the former it
would be equally impolitic that those who are frequently
put to expense in attending patients at a distance, and who
are liable to make reparation to those who may suffer by
their want of skill, should not be certain of a just and honourable
reward. The regulation with regard to barristers
is founded on grounds of public policy, as appears by the
passage in <i>Tacitus</i>, to which Mr. J. <i>Blackstone</i> refers; but
they are totally inapplicable to the case of physicians. And
in that very passage in <i>Tacitus</i> it is taken for granted that
the latter were entitled to a remuneration, because their situation
was dissimilar to that of advocates. Besides in this
case there is an additional reason why the plaintiff should
recover, as there is understood to be a general stipulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_188'>a_188</span>acknowledgment for a physician’s attendance at the place
where this transaction arose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord <span class='sc'>Kenyon</span>, Ch. J. I remember a learned controversy
some years ago as to what description of persons were intended
by the <i>Medici</i> at <i>Rome</i>; and it seemed to have been
clearly established by Dr. <i>Mead</i>, that by those were not
meant physicians, but an inferior degree amongst the professors
of that art, such as answer rather the description of
surgeons amongst us. But at all events it has been understood
in this country that the fees of a physician are honorary,
and not demandable of right. And it is much more
for the credit and rank of that honorable body, and perhaps
for their benefit also, that they should be so considered. It
never was yet heard of that it was necessary to take a receipt
upon such an occasion. And I much doubt whether they
themselves would not altogether disclaim such a right as
would place them upon a less respectable footing in society
than that which they at present hold.</p>

<h3 id='lipscombe' class='c011'>Lipscombe <i>v.</i> Holmes, esq.<br /> <br />(From Campbell.)</h3>

<p class='c012'>This was an action for work and labour as a surgeon, and
for curing the defendant and several persons of his family,
of divers diseases and maladies, under which they had respectively
laboured and languished. The defendant pleaded
the general issue, and paid 3<i>l</i> 13<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i> into court.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first defence set up was, that the plaintiff was a physician,
and therefore could not maintain an action for his
fees. It appeared that he wrote prescriptions, was called
“<i>Doctor</i>,” and signed himself M. D.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Park</i> said he should shew, that at the time when the visits
were paid, for which the action was brought, the plaintiff
was only a surgeon; and that he had not taken out his
diploma as a physician till long after.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_189'>a_189</span>Lord <i>Ellenborough</i>.—If a person passes himself off as a
physician, he must take the character <i>cum onere</i>. When
he brings an action for visits paid by him as a physician, I
will give him credit for being so, and tell him he must trust
to the honour of his patients. Whether the plaintiff had or
had not a diploma when he attended the defendant, is immaterial.
Whatever he was, if he at that time wrote prescriptions
and added M. D. to his name, he must be nonsuited.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Park</i> then produced the rule for paying money into court,
which his lordship thought removed the objection, and admitted
the plaintiff’s right to sue as a surgeon.</p>

and the duty of their business and employment, so ignorantly
and unskilfully treated the plaintiff, that they ignorantly
and unskilfully broke and disunited the callous of the
plaintiff’s leg after it was set, and the callous formed,
whereby he is damaged. The defendants pleaded not
guilty, whereupon issue was joined, which was tried before
the Lord Chief Justice <i>Wilmot</i>, and a verdict found for the
plaintiff, damages £500. The substance of the evidence for
the plaintiff at the trial was, first a surgeon was called, who
swore that the plaintiff having broken both the bones of one
of his legs, this witness set the same, that the plaintiff was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_190'>a_190</span>under his hands nine weeks, that in a month’s time after the
leg was set, he found the leg was healing and in a good way;
the callous was formed, there was a little protuberance, but
not more than usual; upon cross examination he said he was
instructed in surgery by his father, that the callous was the
uniting the bones, and that it was very dangerous to break
or disunite the callous after it was formed.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>John Latham</i> an apothecary swore he attended the plaintiff
nine weeks, who was then well enough to go home, that the
bones were well united, that he was present with the plaintiff
and defendants, and at first the defendants said the plaintiff
had fallen into good hands; the second time he saw them
all together the defendants said the same, but when he saw
them together a third time there was some alteration, he
said the plaintiff was then in a passion, and was unwilling to
let the defendants do any thing to his leg; he said he had
known such a thing done as disuniting the callous, but that
had been only when a leg was set very crooked; but not
where it was straight.</p>

<p class='c000'>A woman called as a witness, swore that when the plaintiff
came home he could walk with crutches, that the defendant
<i>Baker</i> put on to the plaintiff’s leg an heavy steel thing that
had teeth, and would stretch or lengthen the leg, that the
defendants broke the leg again, and three or four months
afterwards the plaintiff was still very ill and bad of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The daughter of the plaintiff swore, that the defendant
<i>Stapleton</i> was first sent for to take off the bandage from
the plaintiff’s leg; when he came he declined to do it
himself, and desired the other defendant <i>Baker</i> might be
called in to assist; when <i>Baker</i> came he sent for the
machine that was mentioned; plaintiff offered to give <i>Baker</i>
a guinea, but <i>Stapleton</i> advised him not to take it then, but
said they might be paid all together when the business was
done; that the third time the defendants came to the plaintiff,
<i>Baker</i> took up the plaintiff’s foot in both his hands and
nodded to <i>Stapleton</i>, and then <i>Stapleton</i> took the plaintiff’s
leg upon his knee, and the leg gave a crack when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_191'>a_191</span>plaintiff cried out to them and said, “you have broke what
nature had formed;” <i>Baker</i> then said to the plaintiff
<em>You must go through the operation of extension</em>, and <i>Stapleton</i>
said we have consulted and done for the best.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another surgeon was called and swore, that in cases of
crooked legs after they have been set, the way of making
them straight is by compression and not by extension, and
said he had not the least idea of the instrument spoken of
for extension; he gave <i>Baker</i> a good character, as having
been the first surgeon of <i>St. Bartholomew’s</i> hospital for
twenty years, and said he had never known a case where
the callous had deossified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another surgeon was called who swore, that when the
callous is formed to any degree, it is difficult to break it,
and the callous in this case must have been formed, or it
would not have given a crack, and said extension was
improper, and if the patient himself had asked him to do it,
he would have declined it, and if the callous had not been
hard he would not have done it without the consent of the
plaintiff, that compression was the proper way, and the
instrument improper; he said the defendant <i>Baker</i> was
eminent in his profession. Another surgeon was called who
swore, that if the plaintiff was capable of bearing his foot
upon the ground, he would not have disunited the callous if
he had been desired by him, but in no case whatever without
consent of the patient; if the callous was loose it was
proper to make the extension to bring the leg into a right
line. A servant of the plaintiff swore the plaintiff had put
his foot upon the ground three or four weeks before this was
done.</p>

<p class='c000'>The counsel for the defendants at the trial, for <i>Baker</i>,
relied upon the good character which was given him, and
objected there was no evidence to affect the other defendant
<i>Stapleton</i> the apothecary; but the Lord Chief Justice
thought there was such evidence against both the defendants
as ought to be left to the jury, as the nodding, the advising
<i>Baker</i> not to take the guinea offered to him by the plaintiff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_192'>a_192</span>besides the apothecary first proposed sending for <i>Baker</i>;
the plaintiff was in no pain before they extended his leg,
and he only sent to <i>Stapleton</i> to have the bandage taken off:
the Lord Chief Justice asked the Jury whether they intended
to find the damages against both the defendants, and they
found £500 against them jointly, and he said he was well
satisfied with the verdict.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now moved that the verdict ought to be set aside
because the action is upon a joint contract, and there is no
evidence of a joint undertaking by both defendants; the
plaintiff sends for <i>Stapleton</i> to take off the bandage who
declines doing it, and says, I do not understand this matter,
you must send for a surgeon; accordingly <i>Mr. Baker</i> is sent
for, who enters upon the business as a surgeon unconnected
with <i>Stapleton</i>, who, it does not appear, ever undertook for
any skill about the leg, so the jury have found him guilty
without any evidence. That <i>Baker</i> has been above twenty
years the first surgeon in <i>St. Bartholomew’s</i> hospital, reads
lectures in surgery and anatomy, and is celebrated for his
knowledge in his profession as well as his humanity; and to
charge such a man with ignorance and unskilfulness upon
the records of this court is most dreadful; all the witnesses
agreed Mr. <i>Baker</i> doth not want knowledge, therefore this
verdict ought not to stand. 2dly, It was objected that the
evidence given does not apply to this action, which is upon
a joint contract; the evidence is that the callous of the leg
was broke without the plaintiff’s consent; but there is no
evidence of ignorance or want of skill, and therefore the
action ought to have been trespass <i>vi &amp; armis</i> for breaking
the plaintiff’s leg without his consent; all the surgeons said
they never do any thing of this kind without consent, and if
the plaintiff should not be content with the present damages,
but bring another action of trespass <i>vi &amp; armis</i>, could this
verdict be pleaded in bar? the court without hearing the
counsel for the plaintiff gave judgment for him.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Curia</i>: 1st, It is objected that this is laid to be a joint
undertaking, and therefore it ought to be proved, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_193'>a_193</span>are of opinion that it ought; the question therefore is,
whether there is any evidence of a joint undertaking; we
are of opinion there is; Mr. <i>Stapleton</i> declines acting alone,
but in concurrence with Mr. <i>Baker</i> attends the plaintiff
every time any thing is done, and assists jointly with Mr.
<i>Baker</i>; this appears in evidence, and is sufficient, for there
is no occasion to prove an express joint contract, promise or
undertaking; when an offer is made to <i>Baker</i> of a guinea,
<i>Stapleton</i> says, you had better be paid all at last; they
both attended plaintiff together every time, and <i>Stapleton</i>
said, we have consulted and done for the best; when the
plaintiff complained of what they had done, <i>Stapleton</i> considered
himself as one of the persons to join in the cure of
the leg, for he put his hand on the knee when <i>Baker</i> nodded,
and then the bone cracked; he is the original person aiding
in this matter, and there is no ground for this objection.
When we consider the good character of <i>Baker</i>, we cannot
well conceive why he acted in the manner he did; but many
men very skilful in their profession have frequently acted
out of the common way for the sake of trying experiments;
several of the witnesses proved that the callous was formed,
and that it was proper to remove <a id='the2'></a>the plaintiff home; that he
was free from pain and able to walk with crutches; we
cannot conceive what the nature of the instrument made use
of is; why did <i>Baker</i> put it on when he said that plaintiff
had fallen into good hands, and when plaintiff only sent for
him to take off the bandage, it seems as if Mr. <i>Baker</i> wanted
to try an expedient with this new instrument.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>2dly</i>, It is objected that this is not the proper action, and
that it ought to have been trespass <i>vi &amp; armis</i>; in answer to
this, it appears from the evidence of the surgeons that it was
improper to disunite the callous without consent; this is the
usage and law of surgeons; then it was ignorance and unskilfulness
in that very particular, to do contrary to the rule of
the profession, what no surgeon ought to have done; and
indeed it is reasonable that a patient should be told what is
about to be done to him, that he may take courage and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_194'>a_194</span>himself in such a situation as to enable him to undergo the
operation; it was objected this verdict and recovery cannot
be pleaded in bar to an action of trespass <i>vi &amp; armis</i> to be
brought for the same damage; but we are clear of opinion
it may be pleaded in bar. That the plaintiff ought to
receive a satisfaction for the injury, seems to be admitted;
but then it is said the defendants ought to have been charged
as trespassers <i>vi &amp; armis</i>; the court will not look with eagle’s
eyes to see whether the evidence applies exactly or not to the
case, when they can see the plaintiff has obtained a verdict for
such damages as he deserves, they will establish such verdict
if it be possible. For any thing that appears to the court
this was the first experiment made with this new instrument,
and if it was, it was a rash action, and he who acts rashly
acts ignorantly; and although the defendants in general
may be as skilful in their respective professions as any two
gentlemen in <i>England</i>, yet the court cannot help saying
that in this particular case they have acted ignorantly and
unskilfully, contrary to the known rule and usage of
surgeons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judgment for the plaintiff <i>per totam curiam</i>.</p>

<hr class='c021' />
<h3 id='seare' class='c011'>Seare <i>against</i> Prentice.<br /> <br /><i>From 8 East.</i></h3>

<p class='c012'>This was an action on the case brought by the plaintiff,
a shoemaker, against the defendant, whom he employed as
a surgeon, for negligently, ignorantly, and unskilfully reducing
a dislocated elbow and fractured arm of the plaintiff,
of which he had undertaken the cure. The cause was tried
before <i>Heath</i> J. at the last assizes at <i>Hertford</i>; and a verdict
having been given for the defendant under the direction
of the learned Judge; that direction was now impeached, and
a rule <i>nisi</i> for setting aside the verdict and granting a new
trial was moved for by <i>Gurney</i>, upon the ground that there
was evidence laid before the jury of the <em>unskilful</em> treatment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_195'>a_195</span>of the plaintiff by the defendant; but that they were told by
the learned Judge, that unless <em>negligence</em> were proved, they
could not examine into the <em>want of skill</em>: and the evidence,
he now admitted, did not substantiate the charge of <em>negligence</em>,
though it proved the want of skill. And he referred
to <i>Slater</i> v. <i>Baker</i><a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a>, to shew that an action lay against a
surgeon for ignorance and unskilfulness in his profession:
and to <i>Bull, N. P. 73.</i> where the general rule is laid down,
that in all cases where a damage accrues to another by the
negligence, ignorance, or misbehaviour of a person in the
duty of his trade or calling, an action on the case will lie:
as if a farrier kill my horse by bad medicines, or refuse to
shoe, or prick him in the shoeing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court granted a rule <i>nisi</i>. And now, upon the Judge’s
Report being read, the case appeared to be this:</p>

<p class='c000'>The plaintiff’s brother-in-law proved, on his behalf, that
on the 2d of <i>April</i> 1805, the defendant attended the plaintiff,
who had fallen from a horse, and told the defendant
that his arm was broken: the defendant said that he thought
the arm, which was swollen, was not broken, and applied
vinegar to it, and bound it with tape. That the plaintiff was
under the defendant’s care for ten weeks without being
cured: he could not bend his arm or work at his trade.
That he then applied to Mr. <i>Kingston</i>, another surgeon, and
after some time could work, and put his arm to his head.
On cross-examination the same witness proved that the
defendant was first sent for at night, and came directly; that
he regularly attended the plaintiff every day but one till the
latter applied to Mr. <i>Pidcock</i>, another surgeon, who, about
nine or ten days after the accident, attended and assisted
with the defendant in setting the elbow. Mr. <i>Kingston</i>, the
surgeon, then proved that in <i>July</i> 1805 the plaintiff was
brought to him a cripple in his arm, one bone of which
was broken obliquely below the elbow. That the plaintiff’s
arm was almost straight; he could not turn his wrist, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_196'>a_196</span>had no motion in his elbow. That the witness broke the
callous and set it again, and made (what the witness himself
described as) a very fine cure, which was spoken of about
the country. He imputed the failure of the defendant in
his attempt to cure the plaintiff to <em>negligence and carelessness</em>:
an apprentice boy (he said) might have known better:
that the bone might have been set within five hours after the
accident; though he admitted that the swelling, if much,
must first be reduced, which might take a fortnight. And
he recommended the plaintiff to bring an action. He also
spoke to a conversation with the defendant, who considered
it as a very difficult dislocation to reduce; and said that he
would make a compensation to the plaintiff. The learned
Judge told the jury that the gist of the action was negligence;
of which direct evidence might be given; or it
might be inferred by the jury, if the defendant had proceeded
without any regard to the common ordinary rules of
his profession, <em>That unskilfulness alone, without negligence,
would not maintain the action</em>. And that he was at
a loss to state to the jury what degree of skill ought to be
required of a village surgeon. But that, whether or not his
direction were accurate in this respect, at any rate the
witness <i>Kingston</i> imputed only <em>negligence</em> and <em>carelessness</em>
to the defendant and <i>Pidcock</i>, in not discovering the fracture
of the bone of the arm when they reduced the dislocated
elbow; which there was no doubt was properly reduced:
and that considering all the circumstances of the case, he
did not think that such gross negligence was imputable to
the defendant as to make him liable in damages to the
plaintiff. The report concluded by stating that the jury
found a verdict for the defendant, much to the Judge’s
satisfaction; who intimated that the vaunting language of
the witness <i>Kingston</i> must have diminished his credit with
the jury.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Shepherd</i> Serjt. and <i>Espinasse</i> were now to have shewn
cause: but though all the Court seemed to be satisfied, as
well now as when the rule was moved for, that the action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_197'>a_197</span>well lay for unskilfulness in the profession of a surgeon;
yet upon a revision of the evidence as reported, they asked
of the plaintiff’s counsel what evidence there was of <em>want
of skill</em> in the defendant; <i>Kingston</i>, the surgeon, only
imputing to him <em>negligence</em> and <em>carelessness</em>; which the
learned Judge had stated to be a ground of action, and had
left to the jury for their consideration; but which the jury
had negatived; as indeed the evidence well warranted them
in doing.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Gurney</i>, in support of the rule, said, that it was to be
collected from the whole of <i>Kingston’s</i> evidence that he
imputed want of skill to the defendant; and that was shewn
by the expression used by him, that an apprentice boy
might have known better. That so much skill at least was
required of a surgeon as to be able to tell whether or not an
arm was broken, or an elbow dislocated. But it was enough
that the question of want of skill was wholly withdrawn from
the consideration of the jury.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord <i>Ellenborough</i> C. J. The surgeon who was examined
specifically imputed the failure of the cure to <em>negligence</em>
and <em>carelessness</em>, whatever other expression he may
have used in the manner of giving his evidence, upon which
the learned Judge has commented. Therefore, however we
may differ from the learned Judge, as I certainly do, in
thinking that an ordinary degree of skill is necessary for a
surgeon who undertakes to perform surgical operations;
which is proved by the case in <i>Wilson</i>, and indeed by all
analogous authorities; in the same manner as it is necessary
for every other man to have it in the course of his employment;
as the farrier who undertakes to cure any horse must
have common skill at least in his business, and that is
implied in his undertaking: and although I am ready to
admit that a surgeon would be liable for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">crassa ignorantia</span></i>,
and would be justly responsible in damages for having rashly
adventured upon the exercise of a profession, without the
ordinary qualification of skill, to the injury of a patient: yet
the question did not arise upon the evidence in this case;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_198'>a_198</span>for no want of skill was imputed to the defendant: and
therefore the opinion of the learned Judge upon that point
does not affect the merits of the verdict upon the evidence
in the cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other Judges concurred; and <i>Grose</i> J. referred to
3 <i>Blac. Com.</i> (<i>ch.</i> 9. <i>p.</i> 163, 4.) as confirming the general
doctrine.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Serjeant <i>Lens</i> appeared to show cause against a rule
obtained in this case. The case arose out of the well-known
one of Messrs. <i>Severn</i>, <i>King</i>, and Co., sugar-refiners, against
some of the Insurance Companies, for losses sustained in the
destruction of their extensive premises, near Whitechapel.
It will be recollected, that in the two trials which arose out
of that event, a great number of scientific men were examined
on both sides as to the result of experiments made by
them in the process of boiling sugar by means of heated oil.
The verdict in both cases, as is known, was for the plaintiffs.
In the bill of costs, sent in to the defendants, charge was
made for the attendance of the learned chymists, who gave
evidence for the plaintiffs, and also for their loss of time and
trouble in making those experiments. Other charges were
made for the expense of the experiments themselves. The prothonotary
who taxed the costs allowed both the charges in principle,
though not to the extent set down in the bill. It was in
consequence of having made those allowances that a rule had
been granted to show cause why he should not review his
taxation of costs.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_202'>a_202</span>Mr. Sergeant <i>Lens</i>, in showing cause against the rule,
contended that the allowance for loss of time to Dr. <i>Thomson</i>
was a very natural and just one. Dr. <i>Thomson</i> was
Professor of Chymistry in the University of <i>Glasgow</i>, and
had been obliged to come up to <i>London</i> three times, at considerable
inconvenience and expense, to give evidence in the
case. He had been at great trouble in making and superintending
experiments, and the prothonotary, in taking the
costs, had allowed a reasonable sum for the whole. It was
the same in the cases of the other scientific gentlemen who
attended.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary here observed, that he considered the
allowance for expenses and loss of time of Dr. <i>Thomson</i>
and other gentlemen as very just. It was usual to allow for
loss of time in such cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Chief Justice</span> said, that in certain cases allowances
were made for loss of time, and the question here was,
how far the present case came within the rules of those
allowances. As a general principle, allowances to witnesses
for loss of time could not be maintained. No doubt it was
a great inconvenience, that individuals whose business required
their whole time should be obliged to devote part of
that time to the concerns of others without reward; but it
was an inconvenience to which all were equally subject in
turn; and as it was to answer the ends of public justice, it
ought to be borne. As to allowance for loss of time, he considered
the thing decided by the case of <i>Willis</i> v. <i>Peckkan</i>
(4th <i>Moore</i>). An action had been brought in that case to
recover 3<i>l.</i> for loss of time whilst giving evidence in a case.
It was contended for the defendants that no such action
could be maintained, except by medical men and attornies.
The court was of the same opinion; but the jury, nevertheless,
found a verdict for the plaintiff. In the following term
a motion was made to have the verdict set aside and a nonsuit
entered. The court, after hearing the arguments on
both sides, decided that a nonsuit must be entered; and
further held, that only medical men and attornies could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_203'>a_203</span>charge for loss of time, as witnesses. The matter was settled,
before, in the Court of King’s Bench, in the case of “<i>Moore</i>
v. <i>Adam</i>.” The court were therefore of opinion, that as
far as this allowance for loss of time, the taxation should be
reviewed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Lens</i> then proceeded to other parts of the
rule, and contended that the apportioning of the costs between
the Phœnix and Imperial Insurance was the fairest
mode which could be adopted, as each had two actions,
though they were not all tried, and the evidence in each
was the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i> asked how much the expense of the experiments
made amounted to.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary said that all the items were so mixed
up, that it would be impossible to ascertain at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>—It is important that the charge for experiments
should be known. The opinion of men of science
is received as evidence, because it arises from pre-existing
science; but surely, as in the present case, they ought not
to acquire their knowledge at the expense of the parties
against whom their evidence is to weigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Vaughan</i>, on the same side with Sergeant
<i>Lens</i>, submitted that it could never have been intended that
men should not be allowed some recompense for loss of time.
It would be not only an injustice, but a cruelty in many
cases, if such a principle were to be adopted. Indeed, the
principle was constantly departed from, in cases where the
time of individuals had been a good deal engaged. In the
case of <i>Lopez</i> v. <i>De Tastet</i>, the evidence of a Spanish captain
of a ship was taken, and it caused him to delay a considerable
time in town, and in the taxing of the costs a round
sum was very properly allowed by the prothonotary, which,
no doubt, was meant not merely to cover his expenses in
town, but to compensate him for the loss of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—We had a consultation, not long since,
in a well-known case, and in another place, whether the
profits of a voyage should not be allowed for, and as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_204'>a_204</span>whether a certain sum given to a captain of a ship should be
looked upon as compensation for loss of time, or in the light
of a bribe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Vaughan</i> said he knew the case to which his
lordship alluded. He went on to say, that the prothonotary
had not made any specific allowance for loss of time as
such, but had mentioned one sum for trouble, expense, and
loss of time. As to the costs of the experiments which had
been made, he submitted that in a case where the subject
was quite new, and as they were not made wantonly or with
a view to put a party to unnecessary expense, the costs of
them ought to be allowed. They were made <i>bona fide</i> for
this case; the materials and apparatus were also provided
with reference to the present case alone. Under such circumstances,
he submitted that they ought to be allowed;
and he ought to add, that their affidavits set forth, that the
experiments were made in consequence of its being known
that similar experiments were made on the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Taddy</i> followed on the same side, and observed,
that while he admitted the general principle that expenses
were not allowed for loss of time, except to physicians
and attornies, he could not see why scientific men,
such as chymists, should not be brought under the same rule
as physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—For this reason, that to a physician
loss of time is considered as loss of profit. A physician cannot
visit a patient by deputy, as the patient might not have
the same confidence in that person as in that physician, and
this I take to be the reason why the loss of time is allowed.
For reasons similar in principle the loss is also compensated
in the attorney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Park</i>.—Suppose a clergyman, living in Cumberland,
were summoned to give evidence in a <a id='cas'></a>case in London,
and that being delayed here for two or three weeks, he
was obliged to employ a curate to officiate in his absence,
have you any case where that expense would be allowed?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_205'>a_205</span>The Prothonotary.—Invariably the expenses would be allowed,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Park</i>.—I am glad to know it, for I was not
aware how the case was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Taddy</i> then proceeded to contend, that with
respect to the cost of the experiments, as they were not
made for the purposes of general science, but had reference
to this case alone, they ought to be allowed. Indeed, they
were made by a sort of compact with the other side. They
(the defendants) themselves seemed anxious that such experiments
should be made. They declared that they would
make them, and they invited the plaintiffs to make them also.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—How much was the amount of the
property insured?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Lens</i> replied that it was upwards of 70,000l.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—I think (whether the cost of experiments
be allowed or not) it was right, in a case of such importance,
that they should have been made; but I wish it
could be shewn to me whether there was any compact between
the parties for making them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Hullock</i>, who appeared for the defendants,
here observed that he knew of no compact of that nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Taddy</i>.—I do not say, my lords, that there
was a positive compact; but I remember that, when the motion
for a new trial was argued before your lordships, one of
the arguments used in support of the motion by the defendants’
counsel was, that a sufficient number of experiments
had not then been made. Surely, then, it will not be contended
that there was not an inducement to the plaintiffs to
make those additional experiments for which they now claim
to be allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Burrough</i>.—There was no contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Taddy</i>.—None, my lord; but they challenged
us to make the experiments. We have done so; and
I submit to your lordships that the verdict being for us, we
ought to charge them with the full costs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Hullock</i>, in support of the rule, contended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_206'>a_206</span>that the case of <i>Lopez</i> and <i>de Tastet</i>, which had been quoted
by his learned brother (<i>Vaughan</i>), was not in point, nor did
it bear the interpretation which had been given to it. As to
physicians, he had some doubt whether in strict law even
they ought to be allowed for loss of time as such, for how
was the rule of expenses to be settled? One physician whose
practice was extensive, might charge fifty guineas a day,
while another might be satisfied to go to Guildhall for five;
so that there could be no settled rule. He thought also,
though he did not at all mean it invidiously, that the plaintiffs
need not have sent to the great distance they had done
for witnesses, while they could have got others of equal skill
nearer home. If the principle were to be admitted, a man
might send to <i>Calcutta</i> for witnesses for scientific purposes,
and charge the expenses of the voyage here and back. At
the same time he did not mean to object to Dr. <i>Thomson</i>,
who he had no doubt was an extremely clever man. The
learned Sergeant then went through various items in the bill,
several of which, he contended, his clients ought not to be
called upon to pay. There was one item of 205<i>l.</i> for a model
of the premises. Why, if, as had been suggested, they had
built a model of exactly the same size as the original, they
might as well charge the price of it, as 250l. for a model.
There was another item of 213l. for loss of time, trouble,
and expenses, in making experiments, to S. Parkes, esq.
Of this the <a id='pro2'></a>prothonotary had deducted 99l., but then it was
not stated what sum was for loss of time, what for the trouble,
and what for the expenses. It was the same with the
charges to several other gentlemen. Now he objected to any
thing being allowed for loss of time, and in that case he was
satisfied the case ought to be reviewed. With respect to the
costs of the experiments, he apprehended that the best answer
had been given by the court. In no case that he heard
of before this were they charged.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i> asked what was the rule in patent cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary said that in all such cases a reasonable
sum was allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_207'>a_207</span>Mr. Sergeant <i>Hullock</i> proceeded. There was another
ground on which he thought the experiments ought not to be
charged. Either there had been several experiments made
before the new method was adopted, or there had not. If
there had, no additional experiments were <a id='nec'></a>necessary on the
late trials. If there had not, the plaintiffs had rashly made
the risk, and ought not to recover now.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—You forgot, brother <i>Hullock</i>, that
this was a patent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergeant <i>Hullock</i>.—That, my lord, strengthens my
argument, for in that case it must have been so well known,
as not to need any additional experiments. The learned
Sergeant was proceeding to contend that the division of the
costs equally between the two insurance companies was not
the most proper one; but the court thought that such an arrangement
would best meet the justice of the case. There
were two insurance companies in the case, in each of which
two policies had been effected, and two actions commenced;
and though all the actions were not tried, yet as the same
evidence went to all, it was but just that each office should
bear a moiety of the costs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arguments being closed on both sides, the <i>Chief Justice</i>
asked whether physicians were allowed for loss of time
as witnesses?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary replied, that they were always allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court then wished to be informed, whether there was
a particular scale of allowance, for it was not to be supposed
that such an eminent physician as Dr. <i>Baillie</i> would be allowed
according to the extent of his practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prothonotary said certainly not. There was an average
allowance, and by that the most eminent physician received
only the same sum as the physician who had got his
diploma but the day before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—What sum would you allow?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary.—My lord, since the allowance has
been raised to barristers, we have raised physicians to the
same rank, and they are allowed the same—two guineas per
day.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_208'>a_208</span>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—But do barristers take the allowance?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary.—In some cases, my lord, it is allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i> (after consulting for a short time with
the other Judges) said we shall not say any thing more upon
this, than that it must be referred back to the master to revise
the costs, and that the experiments are not to be allowed:
nor is allowance to be made for loss of time as such; but let
it be understood that physicians are to be allowed as usual.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary begged to know how he was to reckon
physicians, was it by diploma?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court said by practice. It was not to be expected
that a physician was to take his diploma about in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prothonotary again begged to trouble their lordships.
There was another class of persons who were frequently allowed
much more than any professional men—he meant surveyors.
Sometimes very high charges were made for them.
For instance, the late Mr. <i>Rennie</i>, who was summoned as a
witness in the present case: his time was of the utmost value,
as was that of others of eminence in that branch of science.
He wished to know how they were to be allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Chief Justice</i>.—We can know no distinction here.
The time of such gentlemen as the late Mr. Rennie must no
doubt be extremely valuable to them, but that of a poor man
is equally valuable to him, and perhaps more so; for though
the amount might not be as great, yet the support of his family
might be depending on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rule made absolute; and it was further ordered, that a
moiety of the taxed costs should be paid by each of the Insurance
Offices in question.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was another case of “<i>Severn</i> v. <i>Slade</i>,” turning
exactly on the same point, which was not argued, as of
course the same decision will apply to it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>[Lord Coke, in his Commentary upon Littleton, fol.
8. a. considers, who may inherit lands or tenements; and
about the close of his remarks on that head, introduces the
case of a woman brought to bed of a child, so as to raise a
question whether the child was by her deceased first husband
or by her second husband. His words are, “If a
man hath a wife and dieth; and within a very short time
after the wife marries again, and within nine months hath
a child, so that it may be the child of the one or the other,
some have said that in this case the child may choose his
father, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia in hoc casu filiatio non potest probari</span></i>; and
so is the book to be intended: for avoiding of which
question and other inconveniencies, this was the law before
the conquest, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sit omnis vidua sine marito duodecim
mensibus, et si maritaverit perdat dotem</span></i>.” In the margin
also of the same book, he thus refers to authorities, “21 E.
8. 39 Pancirollus Nova Rep. 485, &amp;c. Opus eximium, 48.
b. Lambard de priscis Anglorum Legibus, 120. 72, &amp;c.”
and as to the year-book of E. 3. so cited, it shews, that the
doctrine, of allowing the infant to choose which of the two
husbands should be his father in the case so put, was attributed
to Sir William de Bereford, who was made chief
justice of the common pleas early in 2 E. 2.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far Lord Coke only puts a special case barely involving
a consideration of the legal time for a woman’s going with
child.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in a subsequent part of his commentary, Lord Coke
brings forward an adjudged case of 18 E. 1. which materially
involved considering what was the limit to the time
for a woman’s parturition, and for which he refers to <i>Trin.</i>
18 <i>E.</i> 1. <i>Rot.</i> 61. <i>Bedford coram rege</i>; and so Lord Coke
was led to giving his own idea of the latest legitimate time
<i>pariendi</i> for women. The passages here meant to be adverted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_210'>a_210</span>to are in Co. Litt. 123. b. and are in these words.
“It was found by verdict, that Henry the son of Beatrice,
which was the wife of Robert Radwell deceased, was
born <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per undecim dies post ultimum tempus legitimum
mulieribus constitutum</span></i>. And therefore it was adjudged,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quòd dictus Henricus dici non debet filius prædicti Roberti
secundùm legem et consuetudinem Angliæ constitutus</span></i>.
Now <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legitimum tempus</span></i> in that case appointed by law at
the furthest is nine months or forty weeks: but she may
be delivered before that time. Which judgment I thought
good to mention. And this agreeth with that in Esdras:
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vade et interroga prægnantem si quando impleverit novem
menses suos, adhuc poterit matrix ejus retinere partum in
semetipsâ? et dixi non potest, Domine</span></i>.” In the margin
of the last passage of this extract from Co. Litt. 123. b.
there is a reference to 4 Esdras 4. 41. and Panciroll.
Nova Reporta, pag. 485, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two extracts from Co. Litt. 8. a. and 123. b. are
here given as an introduction to the following article, which
consists of two notes by the author in the first part of the
13th edition of the Coke upon Littleton, being the author’s
part of that edition, and the first attempt at editing that
ever to be valued work with notes.—Both the notes are on
the second of the two preceding extracts from the Coke upon
Littleton.—The first of the two notes chiefly relates, to the
special case of a widow’s marrying a second husband, and
being delivered of a child so soon after the death of her first
husband, as to raise a doubt, which of the two husbands
should be considered as the father: and so far such note
applies as well to the case so put in Co. Litt. 8. a. from the
year-book of 21 E. 3. 39. as to the case in 18 E. 1. so stated
in Co. Litt. 123. b. from the king’s bench record of that
year.—The second of the two notes relates to the general
point as to the ultimate legitimate time for a woman’s parturition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further as to the following article, it is proper to apprize
the reader, that, exclusively of what is now added by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_211'>a_211</span>note at the bottom of the page, it was first published about
30 years ago.]</p>

<h3 class='c011'>TWO NOTES, &amp;c.</h3>

<h4 class='c014'>I. <i>Note as to Lord Coke’s cited Legitimacy Case of Radwell, in 18 E. 1.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Lord Hale, in a manuscript note about legitimacy in
Co. Litt. fol. 8. a. gives a fuller extract of this case of 18. E.
1. from the record than is here expressed. His words are
these.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Trin. 18 E. 1. Coram rege, rot. 13. Bedford, et M. 22,
23 E. 1. rot. 2. <i>In assise by John Radwell against Henry
son of Beatrice, who was wife of Robert Radwell</i>, quia compertum
est, quòd dictus Henricus fuit natus per 11 dies
post 40 septimanas, quod tempus est usitatum mulieribus
pariendi, ex quo prædictus Robertus non habuit accessum
ad prædictam Beatricem per unum mensem ante mortem
suam, præsumitur dictum Henricum esse bastardum, ideo
<i>judgment for the plaintiff</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If this state of the case is correct, Lord Coke’s is erroneous
in several particulars of consequence.—1. He is short in not
expressing, that the record mentions <em>forty weeks</em>, and so
leaving it to be deemed an <em>inference</em> of his own, as which it
hath been accordingly treated.—2. He exceeds the record,
by representing it to stile <em>that time</em> the <em>latest</em> for a woman’s
going with child, when the record only calls it the <em>usual</em>
period.—3. He wholly omits the husband’s having had <em>no
access to his wife for one month before his death</em>; a fact
very material, it being very easy to allow <em>eleven days</em> after
the <em>usual</em> time, but requiring a strong case to warrant extending
such liberality to nearly <em>six weeks</em>.—4. The word
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præsumitur</span></i>, which Lord Coke passes over, is of importance;
for it indicates, that, notwithstanding the great excess of
time, it was conceived to create only a <em>presumption</em> for the
bastardy, and consequently, if very cogent circumstances to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_212'>a_212</span>account for the protraction of the birth, and in favour of the
wife’s chastity, had occurred, the judgment might have been
for the legitimacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far we had advanced, when on looking into Rolle’s
Abridgment, 536. we found the same ancient case of Radwell
more at large, than either in Lord Coke or Lord Hale.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Rolle agrees with Lord Coke, as well in respect to
the record’s not mentioning the <em>forty weeks</em>, as to its stating
the birth to be eleven days after the <em>latest time in law for a
woman’s going with child</em>; and as from Rolle’s particularity
he seems to have most minutely attended to the record, his
authority, till the whole record appears, seems most decisive.</p>

<p class='c000'>However the two last particulars, in which Lord Coke
differs from Lord Hale, still remain, to which Rolle adds
these further circumstances: namely,—that the <em>husband
languished of a fever a long time before his death</em>;—that on
the taking of an inquisition afterwards in the court of a lord,
of whom he held lands by knight’s service, <em>the wife swore
she was not pregnant</em>, and to prove it uncovered herself in
open court;—and that, in consequence of all this, the lord
received a <em>collateral</em> relation as heir. The words describing
the wife’s exposure of her person are remarkable; for the
record states, that she, being interrogated, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">juramento asserebat,
se non esse prægnantem; et, ut hoc omnibus manifestè
liqueret, vestes suas ad tunicam exuebat, et in plená
curiá sic se videri permisit</span></i>. 1 Ro. Abr. 356. pl. 3. and 18
E. 1. rot. 13. in B. R. there cited. It reflects great discredit,
on the lord’s court, which permitted such a gross indecency;
and still more on the king’s judges, who suffered
it to be recorded as one of the grounds for a verdict before
them. How laudably contrariant is the proceeding on the
writ <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de ventre inspiciendo</span></i>? This remedy for the heir against
the pretence of pregnancy, so well known to be of earlier
date than the reign of Edward the first, as it was framed in
the times of Bracton, Britton, and Fleta, delicately requires
the widow to be inspected by a jury <em>of her own sex</em>; and
though in subsequent times the sheriff was ordered to summon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_213'>a_213</span>a jury composed both of men and women, yet still the
<em>search</em> was to be made by the latter only. Bract. 69. a.
Brit. 165. b. Flet. lib 1. c. 15. Reg. Br. Orig. 227. a.
What harsh ideas of the times might we be led to adopt, if
the early introduction of the writ <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de ventre inspiciendo</span></i> did
not demonstrate, that the unseemly record we are observing
upon was a <em>singularity</em>, and so many other testimonies of a
more advanced refinement in judicial proceedings did not
concur to rescue the age of our English Justinian from the
suspicion of a <em>general practice</em> of such barbarism!</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us then suppose the record to be as it is in Rolle;
which is the more probable to be the truth, because a contemporary
judge, who reports its having been <em>produced</em>
on a trial of <a id='leg'></a>legitimacy, represents it much in the same
way. Cro. Jam. 541. But still it will not warrant Lord
Coke’s inferring from it, that <em>forty weeks</em> constitute the
latest time the law allows for a woman’s going with child.
On the contrary, no particular time being mentioned, what
period was meant, must be found out through some other
<em>medium</em>; and as the record states <em>other</em> unfavourable circumstances
besides the excess of time, and that the <em>jury presumed</em>
against the child’s being the issue of the deceased
husband, it seems fair to suppose, that the law was understood,
not to be so strict in the time alluded to, whatever
that time might be, as indiscriminately to condemn as illegitimate
all children not born within it, but rather to consider
every excess, unless very <a id='ext'></a>extraordinary indeed, as only
raising a presumption against them. This construction is
clearly most consistent with the terms of the record in
question. In the next note we shall attempt to satisfy the
reader, that the rule resulting from it is most conformable
to other precedents and <a id='aut'></a>authorities, as well as to the reason
of the thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the case of Radwell from the Record of E. 1. Lord
Hale thus gives the four following cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rot. Parl. 9 E. 2. M. 4. Gilbert de Clare comes Glouc.

livery till</i> Pasch. 10 E. 2. <i>but the question hung in deliberation</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Note 18 R. 2. <i>where a woman in such a case immediately
after the death of the first husband took a second husband,
and had issue born forty weeks and eleven days after
the death of the first husband, and it was held to be the
issue of the second husband</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“M. 17. Jac. B. R. <i>Alsop and Stacey. Andrews dies of

<p class='c000'>“M. 4. Car. in Cur. Ward, <em>and afterwards</em> P. 5. Car. B.R.

days and sixteen hours after his death she is delivered
of a son. Here it was agreed, 1. If she had not married
Duncomb, without question the issue should not be a bastard,
but should be adjudged the son of Thecar. 2. No
averment shall be received that Thecar did not cohabit
with the wife. 3. Though it is possible, that the son might
be begotten after the husband’s death, yet, being a question
of fact, it was tried by a jury, and the son was found to
be the issue of Thecar.</i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Hale’s case of E. 2. appears very extraordinary, the
time from 30 June from 7 E. 2. when the Earl of Gloucester
died, to the <i>quindene</i> of Hilary, or 29 Jan. 9 E. 2, when
the livery to his sister was further postponed in parliament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_215'>a_215</span>being <em>within one day of a year and seven months</em>; which is
a much later date for the delivery of a live child, than the
most liberal in their calculations have hitherto assigned.
However, on reading the printed copy of the original record,
in the rolls of parliament lately published, we find
Lord Hale’s note quite accurate. See Rot. Parl. v. 1. p. 353.—As
to the case of R. 2. it confirms the doubt we have
elsewhere stated of the opinion, that, if a widow marries
again and has a child within nine months after the death of
the first husband, the child may choose his father; and is
an authority for deciding according to the proof of the woman’s
condition when her first husband died. Ante fo. 8. a.

<h4 class='c014'>II. <i>Note on Lord Coke’s Doctrine as to the latest time with Women for Parturition.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>If our law was really as strict in point of time as is here
represented by Lord Coke, it would not sufficiently conform
to the course of nature. The physicians, it is true, generally
call <em>nine</em> months, each being of thirty days, the <em>usual</em> period
for a woman’s going with child. But then they allow, that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_216'>a_216</span>as a delivery may be accelerated by various accidental and
other causes, so it is frequently protracted, not only for
<em>ten days</em> beyond the nine months, but to the end of the
<em>tenth</em> month, and sometimes for a considerably longer time.
See Zach. Quæst. Medico-legal, lib. 1. tit. 2. Justice
therefore requires, that, in the case of posthumous children,
an excess of the usual time should not operate further, than
by raising a proportional <em>presumption</em> against the legitimacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Roman law was very liberal in this respect; for the
<i>decemviri</i> allowed, that a child may be born in the <em>tenth</em>
month; and though a law of the digest excludes the eleventh,
yet the emperor Adrian, after consulting with the philosophers
and physicians, decreed even for this, where the mother
was of good and chaste manners. See Dig. 1. 4. 12.
Paul. Sentent. lib. 4. t. 9. s. 5. Nov. 39, c. 2. t. 17. with
Gothofred’s learned notes on those two texts of the Roman
law. Cod. lib. 6 t. 29. leg. 2. Aul. Gell. lib. 3. cap. 16.
Huber. Prælect. in Dig. lib. 1. tit. 6.</p>

<p class='c000'>A like liberal discretion probably prevails in most countries
in Europe; for an instance of which, we refer to a very respectable
foreign lawyer, who reports a decision by a <em>majority</em>
of judges in the supreme court of Friesland, by which
a child was admitted to the succession, though not born till
three hundred and thirty-three days from the day of the
husband’s death,<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> which period wants only three days of
<em>twelve lunar</em> months. Sand. Decis. Fris. lib. 4. tit. 8. Definit.
10.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_217'>a_217</span>Nor will our own law, notwithstanding what Lord Coke
advances, if the authorities are duly collected and considered,
be found deficient on this interesting subject. Indeed
there is a passage in Britton, which gives countenance
to Lord Coke’s limitation of forty weeks; for this writer
excludes from the inheritance posthumous children not born
within forty weeks from the husband’s death. Britt. 166. a.
However, even this writer seems to extend in some degree
beyond the forty weeks; unless he meant to make the wife’s
conception exactly of equal date with the husband’s death,
which surely is not a very reasonable construction. But
without dwelling on such a nicety, it is sufficient, that the
principal of the few other authorities in our books are against
so rigid a rule. Bracton is very cautious, illegitimatizing only
the issue born so long after the husband’s death, as to create
an improbability of its being his child, without naming
any fixed period. Bract. lib. 5. fo. 417. b.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the determined cases in our courts, the only authorities
of this sort, we meet with, are enumerated in the
preceding annotation; and these, duly weighed, will not
be found, it is apprehended, to warrant Lord Coke’s conclusion.—In
Radwell’s case, the finding against the issue is
expressed to have been grounded merely on <em>presumption</em>;
and besides, if we construe the record properly, the presumption
arose from proof of the husband’s non-access to the
wife a month before his death,—The case of 9 E. 2. is an
instance of allowing so much time beyond forty weeks, that
it seems too strong to have much weight; but so far as it
can claim any, it counts against Lord Coke.—The case of 18
Rich. 2. at first seems full for Lord Coke’s rule, the child,
though born only <em>eleven</em> days beyond the <em>forty weeks</em>, having
been declared not the issue of the deceased husband.
But when it is further considered, there will be found nothing
to prove a <em>positive general</em> rule; for the case was very
special, the widow having married a second husband the
day after the death of the first, so that the question was not
of legitimacy, but merely to which husband the issue belonged.—One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_218'>a_218</span>of the two only remaining cases considerably
extends the time beyond the forty weeks; for in <i>Alsop</i> and
<i>Stacey</i>, the first of them, the issue was found legitimate,
notwithstanding the lapse of forty weeks and <em>ten days</em>, and
the lewd character of the wife: and even as to <i>Thecar’s</i>
case, which is the other of them, the issue having been born
two hundred and eighty-two days, there was an excess of
the forty weeks, though but a trifling one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The precedents therefore, so far from corroborating Lord
Coke’s limitation of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimum tempus pariendi</span></i>, do, upon
the whole, rather tend to shew, that it hath been the practice
in our courts, to consider forty weeks merely as the
more <em>usual</em> time, and consequently not to decline exercising
a discretion of allowing a longer space, where the opinion of
physicians or the circumstances of the case have so required.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of our inquiries into the subject of this note,
we were curious to know the general sentiments of that eminent
anatomist, Dr. Hunter, on three interesting questions.
These were, what is the <em>usual</em> period for a woman’s going
with child, what is the <em>earliest</em> time for a child’s being born
alive, and what the <em>latest</em>. The answer, which he obligingly
returned through a friend, we have liberty to publish; and
it was expressed in the words following:—1. <i>The usual
period is nine calendar months; but there is very commonly
a difference of one, two, or three weeks.</i> 2. <i>A child may be
born alive at any time from three months; but we see none
born with powers of coming to manhood, or of being reared,
before seven calendar months, or near that time. At six
months it cannot be.</i> 3. <i>I have</i> known <i>a woman bear a
living child, in a perfectly natural way, fourteen days later
than nine calendar months, and</i> believe <i>two women to have
been delivered of a child alive, in a natural way, above ten
calendar months from the hour of conception</i>.</p>

twelfth month after the husband’s death. It is taken from

<p class='c016'>The College of Physicians in London being lawfully
assembled by the command of their Sovereign Lord the King,
about certain questions proposed concerning the death of
<i>Joseph Lane</i>, reported to be killed by poison, and having
made a diligent search, and well considering all circumstances
relating; 1. As to the state of the body of the foresaid
Lane; 2. As to the disease which (by a long series of
violent symptoms) brought him to his end; 3. As to the
kind and appearance of his death; 4. As to the observations
made upon his dead body by the Physicians and Chirurgeons
present; 5. As to the conjectures taken from the strict examination
of a <i>bolus</i> extremely suspicious, whose parts were
artificially separated, found in Mr. <i>Lane</i>’s house when dead,
and after brought into Court before the Judges, and from
thence to the Physicians at their College: To whom (by
the command and in the name of the King) Letters were
wrote from the Right honourable Sir John Cooke principal
Secretary of State that they might diligently enquire and
give a faithful account to the following Questions, 1 Concerning
Lane’s death, whether it was procured from Poison?
2 Their opinion about a purging potion carried the 4th of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_226'>a_226</span>April, 1632 from Mr. <i>Mathews</i> an Apothecary’s shop to
<i>Lane’s</i> House; and taken by Lane the 6th, whether it had
any thing of poison in it? The College after very mature
deliberation, did humbly present the following Decree to
his sacred Majesty as a testimony of their obedience.</p>

<p class='c000'>1 That the said <i>Joseph Lane</i> did certainly dye of a violent
death. 2 That he had taken poison, and that corrosive.
3 That they could determine nothing concerning the Potion
sent and given by Mr. <i>Mathews</i> the Apothecary to Mr.
<i>Lane</i> without the advice of any Physician, because many
of their Medicines were too negligently prepared by their
Servants; But if this potion did only consist of those ingredients
which he had given an account of, and for which we
have solely his word, then there was nothing of poison contained
therein. 4. In the remainder of the aforesaid <i>Bolus</i>
there was found Mercury Sublimate, not sweet, but the most
harsh and highly caustick, which was separated from the
rest of the <i>Bolus</i> and shown to the whole College; In testimony
whereof the College by the unanimous Consent of the
President and Fellows and all present at this consultation,
signed this Decree with their own hands, and sealed it with
the College Seal, that it might appear more authentick.</p>

<p class='c000'>And because that from the beginning of the world to this
very day good and wholesome Laws have derived their
original from evil manners, the whole College of Physicians
doe most humbly beseach your most sacred Majesty that as
the Father of your Country, you would consult the health
and welfare both of your City Subjects and would by your
Royal Proclamation strictly command that for the future,
No Grocer, Drugster, Apothecary, Chymist, or any other

Muirhead, Chirurgeons in Edinburgh, having order from
Sir John Dalrymple his Majesty’s Advocate, to go to Morum
and there to take up the Corps of Sir James Standsfield, and
to sight and view the same exactly, and if need were, to
open up the body, and to consider whether there appeared
any evidence of wounds, bruises, or strangling upon the
Corps, besides what might have happened by his falling or
drowning in the water, &amp;c. In obedience thereto, we
caused take up the said corps in the presence of “(here
follow the names)” indwellers in New Milns, and some
others. Having with all possible exactness viewed the corps
we observed the face a little swelled, and inclining to a dark
reddish colour, some fulness of some capillarie veins in the
pallet of the mouth towards the uvula, as also a large and
conspicuous swelling, about three inches broad, of a dark
red or blue colour, from one side of the larinx round backwards
to the other side thereof; we observed the jugular
veins on both sides the neck very large and distended and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_228'>a_228</span>full of blood; there was a large swelling under and betwixt
the chin and the cartilago scutiformis; there was also a
little scratch below the left mandibula, which had rankled
the cuticula, and made some little impression on the cutis:
Having made incission from the chin down about the larinx,
and cross upon the swelling of the neck, we found a greater
laxness and distance (as we think) than ordinary betwixt
the cartilago scutiformis and os hyoides; we found the tumour
on the neck, containing bruised, like dark or blackish
blood; the jugulars, when cut, bled inconsiderably especially
that on the left side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having opened his breast we found the lungs distended
to the filling up their capacities, but free of water: his
stomach, liver &amp;c. were all in good condition; we found no
water at all; the breast, belly, privy parts, &amp;c. were all
well coloured, there was no swelling in his belly, nor any
thing by ordinary to be seen on his head. This we attest

<p class='c012'>We under subscribers, Chirurgeons of Edinburgh,
having fully considered the report made by James Craufurd
and James Murehead concerning the condition of the corps
of Sir James Standsfield, and though it be not usual to declare
more than matter of fact, yet in obedience to your
Lordships commands, where ye desire to be informed, if
these symptoms found upon the body, do import drowning
or strangling; we humbly offer opinion, so far as our art or
experience will allow. And whereas the report informs us,
that there was found a swelling and preternatural redness
in the face, a large conspicuous tumour, about three inches
broad, of a dark red, or black colour, from the one side of
the larynx round backwards to the other side thereof, a
large swelling betwixt the chin and the cartilago scutiformis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_229'>a_229</span>the jugular veins on both sides very much distended; and
when incision was made downwards between the os hyoid
and larinx was observed a laxness, and distance between the
os hyoid and the cartilago scutiformis, incision was made
cross alongst the tumour it was found full of bruised blood;
the jugulars likewise, when opened, yielded a considerable
quantity of blood, especially on the left side, no smell or
corruption appearing in any part of the body. It is very
probable these parts have suffered some external violence,
which hath made them appear so far different from their
natural figure and colour, and could not be caused by
drowning simply. As to the other part of the report, the
breast and belly being opened, the lungs found distended,
the bronchi full of air, without any water, nor any water
found in the stomach or intestines, a body when drowned
being generally found to have much water in it with other
circumstances of the report considered, gives just ground to
think he was not drowned. This we subscribe at Edinburgh

</div>

<p class='c016'>Page 1126. Mr. <i>Coatsworth</i> a Surgeon sworn</p>

<p class='c000'>My Lord in April last I was sent for by Dr. <i>Philips</i>
to come to Hertford to see the body of Mrs. <i>Stout</i> opened,
who had been six weeks buried; and he told me that there
was a suspicion she was murdered, and that her relations
were willing to have her taken up and opened. I came
down I think on the 27th of April, and lay at Mrs. <i>Stout</i>’s
house that night; and by her discourse I understood she
wanted to be satisfied, whether her daughter was with child?
I told her, it was my opinion we should find the parts contained
in the abdomen so rotten, that it would be impossible
to discover the uterus from the other parts; however, if she
would have her opened, I could not discover whether she
was with child, unless the infant was become bony. Her
face and neck, to her shoulders, appeared black, and so
much corrupted that we were unwilling to proceed any further:
but, however, her mother would have it done, and
so we did open her; and as soon as she was opened, we
perceived the stomach and guts were as full of wind as if
they had been blown with a pair of bellows; we put her
guts aside, and came to the uterus, and Dr. <i>Philips</i> shewed
it us in his hand, and afterwards cut it out and laid it on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_231'>a_231</span>the table, and opened it, and we saw into the cavity of it,
and if there had been any thing there as minute as a hair,
we might have seen it, but it was perfectly free and empty;
after that we put the intestines into their places; and we
bid him open the stomach, and it was opened with an incision
knife, and it sunk flat, and let out wind, but no water;
afterwards we opened the breast and lobes of the lungs, and
there was no water; then we looked on each side and took
up the lobes of the lungs too, to see if there was no water in
the <a id='dia'></a>diaphragm, and there was none, but all dry. Then I
remember I said, this woman could not be drowned, for if
she had taken in water, the water must have rotted all the
guts: that was the construction I made of it then; but for
any marks about her head and neck, it was impossible for
us to discover it, because they were so rotten.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Edward Clement</i> (a seaman) sworn. In the year 89 or 90,
in Beachy fight, I saw several thrown over-board during the
engagement, but one particularly I took notice of, that was
my friend, and killed by my side; I saw him swim for a
considerable distance from the ship; and a ship coming
under our stern, caused me to lose sight of him, but I saw
several dead bodies floating at the same time; likewise in
another engagement, where a man had both his legs shot off,
and died instantly, they threw over his legs; though they
sunk I saw his body float: likewise I have seen several men
who have died natural deaths at sea, they have when they
have been dead, had a considerable weight of ballast and
shot made fast to them, and so were thrown overboard; because
we hold it for a general rule, that all men swim if
they be dead before they come into the water; and on the
contrary, I have seen men when they have been drowned,
that they have sunk as soon as their breath was out of their
bodies, and I could see no more of them. For instance, a
man fell out of the Cornwall, and sunk down to rights, and
seven days afterwards we weighed anchor, and he was
brought up grasping his arm about the cable: and we have
observed in several cases, that where men fall overboard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_232'>a_232</span>as soon as their breath is out of their bodies they sink downright;
and on the contrary, where a dead body is thrown
over-board without weight, it will swim. * * * Men
(that are killed) float with their heads just down, and the
small of their backs and buttocks upwards, * * * why
should government be at that vast charge to allow threescore
or fourscore weight of iron to sink any man, but only that
their swimming about should not be a discouragement to
others.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Robert Dew</i> sworn—* * * (Question by the Prisoner)
After she was taken out, did you observe any froth or foam
come from her mouth or nose? <i>Dew</i>—There was a white
froth came from her, and as they wiped it away, it was on
again presently.</p>

<p class='c000'>—— <i>Young</i>—(another witness to a similar question)—* *
And when they had taken her up (out of the water)
they laid her down upon a green place, and after she was
laid down a great quantity of froth, like the froth of new
beer, worked out of her nostrils. * * * It rose up in
bladders, and ran down on the sides of her face, and so rose
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Sloane</i> sworn—* * As to my opinion of drowning
it is plain, that if a great quantity of water be swallowed into
the stomach by the gullet, it will not suffocate or drown
the person: Drunkards who swallow a great deal of liquor,
and those who are forced by the civil law to drink a great
quantity of water, which in giving the question (as it is
called) is poured into them by way of torture to make them
confess crimes, have no suffocation or drowning happen to
them: But on the other hand, when any quantity comes
into the wind-pipe, so as it does hinder or intercept inspiration,
or coming in of the air, which is necessary for inspiration
or breathing, the person is suffocated. Such a small
quantity will do, as sometimes in prescriptions, when people
have been very weak, or forced to take medicines, I have
observed some spoonfuls in that condition (if it went the
wrong way) to have choaked or suffocated the person. I
take drowning in a great measure to be thus, and when one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_233'>a_233</span>struggles he may, to save himself from being choaked,
swallow some quantity of water, yet that is not the cause of
his death, but that which goes into the wind-pipe and lungs.
Whether a person comes dead or alive into the water, I
believe some quantity will go into the wind-pipe; and I
believe without force after death, little will get into the
stomach, because that it should, swallowing is necessary,
which after death cannot be done. * * *</p>

<p class='c000'>Baron <i>Hatsell</i>. But what do you say to this? if there
had been water in the body, would it not have putrified the
parts after it had lain six weeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Sloane</i>. My Lord, I am apt to think it would have
putrified the stomach less than the lungs, because the stomach
is a part of the body that is contrived by nature partly
to receive liquids; but the contrivance of the lungs is only
for the receiving of air; they being of a spongy nature, the
water might sink more into them than the stomach; but I
believe it might putrify there too after some time. I am
apt to think, that when a body is buried under ground,
according to the depth of the grave, and difference of the
weather and soil, the fermentation may be greater or lesser,
and that according to the several kinds of meats or liquids in
the stomach, the putrifaction will likewise vary so that it
seems to me to be very uncertain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Baron <i>Hatsell</i>. But when they are in a coffin, how is
it then?</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Sloane</i>. No doubt there will be a fermentation more
or less, according as the air comes more or less to the body.
Indeed it may be otherwise where the air is wholly shut
out, which is supposed to be the way of embalming, or
preserving of dead bodies of late, without the use of any
spices, which is thought in a great measure to be brought
about by the closeness of the coffin, and hindering of the
air from coming into the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Question (by the Prisoner). Is it possible, in your judgment,
for any water to pass into the thorax?</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Sloane</i>. I believe it is hardly possible, that any should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_234'>a_234</span>go from the wind-pipe into the cavity of the thorax, without
great violence and force; for there is a membrane that covers
the outside of the lungs, that will hinder the water from passing
through it into any part without them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Garth</i> sworn.—* * * All dead bodies (I believe)
fall to the bottom, unless they be prevented by some extraordinary
tumour. * * * I believe when she threw
<em>herself</em> in, she might not struggle to save herself, and by consequence
not sup up much water. Now there is no direct
passage into the stomach but by the gullet, which is contracted
or pursed up by a muscle in nature of a sphincter:
for if this passage was always open like that of the wind-pipe,
the weight of the air would force itself into the stomach, and
we should be sensible of the greatest inconveniences. * * *
My Lord, I think we have reason to suspect the Seaman’s
evidence; for he saith that threescore pound of iron is allowed
to sink dead bodies, whereas six or seven pounds
would do as well; * * the design of tying weights to
their bodies, is to prevent their floating at all, which otherwise
would happen in some few days.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Morley</i>, the next witness, related some experiments
on animals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Wollaston</i>, sworn.—* * I saw two men that were
drowned out of the same boat. They were taken up the
next day after they were drowned; one of them was indeed
prodigiously swelled, so much that his clothes were burst in
several places of his sides and arms, and his stockings in the
seams * * the other was not the least swelled in any
part nor discolored; he was as lank, I believe, as ever he
was in his lifetime, and there was not the least sign of any
water in him, except the watery froth at his mouth and
nostrils.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>W. Cooper</i>, sworn.—* * Dead bodies necessarily
sink in water, if no distention of their parts buoy them up;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_235'>a_235</span>this distention sometimes happens before death, at other
times soon after, and in bodies that are drowned after they
lie under water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Crell</i>, sworn.—My Lord, it must be reading, as well
as a man’s own experience, that will make any one a Physician:
for without the reading of books in that art, the art
itself cannot be attained to: besides, my Lord, I humbly
conceive, that in such a difficult case as this, we ought to
have a great deference for the reports and opinions of learned
men: neither do I see any reason why I should not quote
the fathers of my profession in this case, as well as you gentlemen
of the long robe quote <i>Coke</i> upon <i>Littleton</i> in others.
* * I shall only insist on what <i>Ambrose Pare</i> relates in
his Chapter of Renunciations. * *</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Harriot</i> (a Naval Surgeon) sworn.—* * When we
threw men overboard that were killed, some of them swam
and some sunk * * (when a dead body is thrown overboard)
I always observed that it did sink. * *</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Bartlet</i> (a Naval Surgeon), sworn.—* * I never
saw any bodies float, either of the men that were killed in
our ship, or in the ships that have been near us; I have not
seen a body on the surface of the water.</p>

  <h2 id='blandy' class='c008'>Extracts from the Evidence of Doctor Anthony Addington, on the trial of <i>Mary Blandy</i> at Oxford 1752, for the Murder of her Father by Arsenic.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Anthony Addington &amp; Dr. William Lewis sworn.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Counsel.</i> Did you, Dr. Addington, attend Mr. Blandy in
his last illness?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Addington.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> When was you called to him the first time?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> On Saturday evening August the 10th.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> In what condition did you find him?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> He was in bed; and told me, that after drinking
some gruel on Monday night, August the 5th, he had perceived
an extraordinary grittiness in his mouth, attended
with a very painful burning and pricking in his tongue, throat,
stomach, and bowels, and with sickness and gripings; which
symptoms had been relieved by fits of vomiting and purging.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> <a id='wer'></a>Were those fits owing to any physic he had taken
or to the gruel?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> Not to any physic; they came on very soon
after taking the gruel.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> Had he taken no physic that day?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> No.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> Did he make any further complaints?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> He said, that, after drinking more gruel on
Tuesday night August the 6th, he had felt the grittiness in
his Mouth again, and that the burning and pricking in his
tongue, throat, stomach and bowels, had returned with
double violence and had been aggravated by a prodigious
swelling of the belly, and exquisite pains and prickings in
every external as well as internal part of his body, which
prickings he compared to an infinite number of needles
darting into him all at once.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_237'>a_237</span><i>C.</i> How soon after drinking the gruel?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> Almost immediately. He told me likewise,
that at the same time, he had had cold sweats, hiccup, extreme
restlessness and anxiety; but that then, viz. on
Saturday night August the 10th, having had a great many
stools, and some bloody ones, he was pretty easy every
where, except in his mouth, lips, nose, eyes, and fundament;
and except some transient gripings in his bowels.
I asked him, to what he imputed those uneasy sensations in
his mouth, lips, nose, and eyes? he said to the fumes of
something he had taken in his gruel on Monday night
August the 5th, and Tuesday night August the 6th.</p>

<p class='c000'>On inspection, I found his tongue swelled and his throat
slightly inflamed and excoriated. His lips especially the
upper one were dry and rough, and had angry pimples on
them. The inside of his nostrils was in the same condition.
His eyes were a little blood-shot. Besides these appearances,
I observed that he had a low, trembling, intermitting
pulse; a difficult unequal respiration; a yellowish complexion;
a difficulty in the utterance of his words; and an
inability of swallowing even a tea-spoonful of the thinnest
liquor at a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I suspected that these appearances and symptoms
were the effect of poison, I asked Miss Blandy whether
Mr. Blandy had lately given offence to either of his servants
or clients or any other person? She answered <em>That
he was at Peace with all the World, and that all the World
was at Peace with him</em>. I then asked her whether he had
ever been subject to complaints of this kind before? She
said, that he had often been subject to the cholic and
heart-burn; and that she supposed this was only a fit of
that sort, and would soon go off as usual. I told Mr. Blandy
that I asked these questions because I suspected that by
some means or other he had taken poison. He replied,
<em>It might be so</em>, or in words to that effect: but Miss Blandy
said <em>It was impossible</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Saturday morning August the 10th, he seemed much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_238'>a_238</span>relieved; his pulse, breath, complexion, and power of
swallowing, were greatly mended. He had had several
stools in the night and no blood in them. The complaints
which he had made of his mouth, lips, nose, and eyes
were lessened; but he said the pain in his fundament continued
and that he still felt some pinchings in his bowels.
On viewing his fundament I found it almost surrounded
with gleety Excoriations and Ulcers.</p>

<p class='c000'>About eight o’clock this Morning I took my leave of
him, but before I quitted the room, Miss Blandy desired
I would visit him again the next day.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I got down stairs, one of the maids put a paper
into my hands, which she said Miss Blandy had thrown
into the kitchen fire, several holes were burnt in the
paper but not a letter of the superscription was effaced.
The Superscription was, <em>The Powder to clean the Pebbles
with</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> What is the maid’s name that gave you that paper?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> I cannot recollect which of the maids it was
that gave it to me. I opened the paper very carefully, and
found in it a whitish powder, like white arsenic in taste,
but <a id='sli'></a>slightly discoloured by a little burnt paper mixed with it.
I cannot swear this powder was arsenic or any other poison,
because the quantity was too small to make any experiment
with, that could be depended on.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> What do you really suspect it to be?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> I really suspect it to be white arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> Please to proceed Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> As soon as the maid had left me, Mr. Norton
the <a id='apo2'></a>Apothecary produced a powder, that, he said had been
found at the bottom of that mess of gruel, which, as was
supposed had poisoned Mr. Blandy. He gave me some of
that powder, and I examined it at my leisure, and believe
it to be white arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Monday morning August the 12th I found Mr. Blandy
much worse than I had left him the day before, his bowels
were still in pain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_239'>a_239</span>I now desired that another Physician might be called in,
as I apprehended Mr. Blandy to be in the utmost danger,
and that this affair might come before a Court of Judicature.
Dr. Lewis was then sent for from Oxford. I staid with
Mr. Blandy all this day. I asked him more than once
whether he really thought he had taken poison? He answered
each time, that he believed he had. I asked him
whether he thought he had taken poison often? He answered
in the affirmative. His reasons for thinking so, were,
because some of his teeth had decayed much faster than
was natural; and because he had frequently for some months
past, especially after his daughter had received a present of
<i>Scotch Pebbles</i> from Mr. <i>Cranstoun</i>, been affected with
very violent and unaccountable prickings and heats in his
tongue and throat, and with most intolerable burnings,
and pains in his stomach and bowels, which used to go off
in vomitings and purgings. I asked him whom he suspected
to be the giver of the poison? The tears stood in his eyes;
yet he forced a smile and said—<i>A poor Love-sick Girl—I
forgive her—I always thought there was mischief in those
cursed Scotch Pebbles</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Lewis came about eight o’clock in the evening.
Before he came Mr. Blandy’s complexion, pulse, breath,
and faculty of Swallowing were got much better again; but
he complained more of pain in the fundament.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Addington.</i> On Tuesday morning August the 13th,
we found him worse again. His countenance, pulse, breath
and power of swallowing, were extremely bad. He was
excessively weak. His hands trembled. Both they and
his face were cold and clammy. The pain was intirely
gone from his bowels, but not from his fundament. He
was now and then a little delirious. He had frequently
a short cough, and a very extraordinary elevation of his
chest, in fetching his breath; on which occasions an
ulcerous matter generally issued from his fundament. Yet
in his sensible intervals, he was cheerful and jocose; He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_240'>a_240</span>said, <i>He was like a Person bit by a Mad Dog; for that he
should be glad to drink, but could not swallow</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>About noon this day his speech faultered more and more.
He was sometimes very restless, at others very sleepy. His
face was quite ghastly. This night was a terrible one.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Wednesday morning, August the 14th, he recovered
his senses for an hour or more. He told me, he would
make his will in two or three days; but he soon grew
delirious again; and sinking every moment, died about Two
o’Clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> Upon the whole, did you then think, from the
symptoms you have described, and the observations you
made, that Mr. Blandy died by poison?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> Indeed I did.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> And it is your present opinion?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> It is; and I have never had the least occasion
to alter it. His case was so particular that he had not a
symptom of any consequence, but what other persons have
had, who have taken White Arsenic; and, after death,
had no appearance (<i>except a stone in the Gall bladder</i>)
in his body, but what other persons have had, who have
been destroyed by white arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> When was his body opened?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> On Tuesday in the afternoon, August the 15th.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> What appeard on opening it?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> I committed the appearances to writing, and
should be glad to read them, if the Court will give me
leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Doctor, on leave given by the Court, read as
follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Blandy’s back and the hinder part of his arms, thighs,
and legs were livid. That fat which lay on the muscles
of his belly, was of a loose texture, inclining to a state of
fluidity. The muscles of his belly were very pale and flaccid.
The cawl was yellower than is natural; and on the
side next the stomach and intestines looked brownish.
The heart was variegated with purple spots. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_241'>a_241</span>no water in the pericardium. The lungs resembled bladders
half filled with air and blotted in some places with
pale but in most with black ink. The liver and spleen
were much discoloured; the former looked as if it had been
boiled, but that part of it which covered the stomach was
particularly dark. A stone was found in the gall-bladder.
The bile was very fluid and of a dirty yellow colour, inclining
to red. The kidneys were all over stained with
livid spots. The stomach and bowels were inflated, and
appeared, before any incision was made into them, as if
they had been pinched, and extravasated blood had stagnated
between their membranes. They contained nothing,
as far as we examined, but a slimy bloody froth. Their
coats were remarkably smooth, thin, and flabby. The
wrinkles of the stomach were totally obliterated. The
internal coat of the stomach and duodenum, especially
about the orifices of the former, were prodigiously inflamed
and excoriated. The redness of the white of the
eye, in a violent inflammation of that part, or rather the
white of the eye just brushed and bleeding with the beards
of barley, may serve to give some idea how this coat had
been wounded. There was no schirrus in any gland of the
abdomen; no adhesion of the lungs to the pleura; nor
indeed the least trace of a natural decay in any part whatever.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Prisoners Counsel.</i> Why do you believe it to be White
Arsenic?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. A.</i> For the following Reasons: 1. This Powder has
a milky Whiteness; so has White Arsenic. 2. This is
gritty and almost insipid; so is White Arsenic. 3. Part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_242'>a_242</span>of it swims on the surface of cold water like a pale sulphureous
film; but the greatest part sinks to the bottom, and
remains there undissolved; the same is true of white arsenic.
4. This thrown on red hot iron, does not flame, but rises
entirely in thick white fumes, which have the stench of
garlick; and cover cold iron held just over them, with
white flowers; white arsenic does the same. 5. I boiled
ten grains of this powder in four ounces of clean water,
and then, passing the decoction through a filtre, divided
into five equal parts, which were put into as many glasses:
Into one glass I poured a few drops of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac;
into another some of the Lixivium of Tartar; into the
third some strong Spirit of Vitriol; into the fourth some
Spirit of Salt; and into the last some Syrup of Violets.
The Spirit of Sal Ammoniac threw down a few particles of
pale sediment. The Lixivium of Tartar gave a white cloud,
which hung a little about the middle of the glass. The
Spirits of <a id='vit'></a>Vitriol and Salt made a considerable precipitation
of a lightish coloured substance; which in the former,
hardened into glittering chrystals, sticking to the sides and
bottom of the glass. Syrup of Violets produced a beautiful
pale green tincture. Having washed the saucepan, funnel,
and glasses, used in the foregoing experiments, very clean,
and provided a fresh filtre, I boiled ten grains of white
arsenic bought of Mr. Wilcock, Druggist in Reading, in four
ounces of clean water; and filtering it and dividing it into
five equal parts, proceeded with them just as I had done
with the former decoction. There was an exact similitude
between the experiments made on the two decoctions.
They corresponded so nicely on each trial, that I declare I
never saw any two things in Nature more alike, than the
decoction made with the powder found in Mr. Blandy’s
gruel, and that made with white arsenic. From the experiments,
and others, which I am ready to produce, if desired,
I believe that powder to be White Arsenic.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. Give the Jury an account of the physic you gave him,
and the manner of its operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I asked him where the bottle was: he said it stood
there upon the shelf. First of all he desired me to get him
a bit of cheese in order to take the taste out of his mouth,
which I did: he desired me to read the lable; I accordingly
did, and found there was written upon it, <i>Purging draught
for Sir Theodosius Boughton</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When you gave him the draught, did he make any,
and what observations upon it?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. As I was talking to him I omitted shaking the bottle:
he, observing that, said, Pour it back again, and shake the
bottle, and in so doing I spilt part of it upon the table; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_244'>a_244</span>rest I gave him. As he was taking it, he observed it smelt
and tasted very nauseous; upon which I said, I think it
smells very strongly like bitter almonds. I gave him the
cheese; he chewed it, and spit it out. He then remarked
that he thought he should not be able to keep the medicine
upon his stomach. I asked him if he would have some
water; I gave him some. He washed his mouth, and spit
that out, and then laid down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Please to open that bottle, [giving Lady Boughton
the genuine draught] and smell at it, and inform the Court
whether that smells at all like the medicine Sir Theodosius
took.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, it does not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Please to smell to this, [giving Lady Boughton the
draught with the laurel water added to it.]</p>

<p class='c000'>A. This has a smell very like the smell of the medicine
which I gave him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What was the first observation your Ladyship made
of any appearances upon Sir Theodosius after taking the medicine?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. In two minutes, or two minutes and a half, after he
had taken it, he struggled very much; it appeared to me,
as if it was to keep it down; and made a prodigious rattling
in his stomach, and guggling; and he appeared to me to
make very great efforts to keep it down.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Court.</i> How did he make a rattling?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. A noise in his stomach as if it would come up again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. How long did you observe these symptoms continue?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. About ten minutes; he then seemed as if he was
going to sleep, or inclined to dose. Perceiving him a little
composed, I went out of the room. I returned in about five
minutes after into his room; then, to my great surprise, I
found him with his eyes fixed upwards, his teeth clenched,
and froth running out of each corner of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I ran down stairs, and told the servant to take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_245'>a_245</span>first horse he could get, and go immediately for Mr. Powell,
the Apothecary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was any other person sent for?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When did you first see Mr. Donellan after that?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I saw him in less than five minutes; he came up to
the bed chamber where my son was, and asked me, What
do you want? I said I wanted to inform him what a terrible
thing had happened; that it was an unaccountable thing in
the doctor to send such a medicine, for if it had been taken
by a dog, it would have killed him; and I did not think my
son would live. He asked in what manner Sir Theodosius
was taken; and I told him. Then he asked me where the
physic bottle was? I shewed him the two draughts. He took
up one of the bottles and said, Is this it? Yes, said I. He
took it up, poured some water out of the water bottle, which
was just by, into the phial, shook it, and then emptied it out
into some dirty water which was in a wash-hand bason.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you make any observation upon that conduct?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. After he had thrown the contents of the first bottle
into the wash-hand bason of dirty water, I observed that he
ought not to do that: I said, What are you at? you should
not meddle with the bottle. Upon that he snatched up the
other bottle, and poured water into it, and shook it; then he
put his finger to it, and tasted it. I said, What are you about?
you ought not to meddle with the bottles. Upon which he
said, I did it to taste it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Had he tasted the first bottle?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I was cook.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_246'>a_246</span>Q. Was you sent for by Lady Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I was sent for to my lady, by the other maid, Sarah
Blundell, who is dead. I was called up stairs into that room
where Sir Theodosius lay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When you came into the room in what situation was
Sir Theodosius Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. He did not stir hand or foot, but frothed at his mouth.
I wiped the froth four or five times from his mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was the body motionless?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The stomach heaved very much.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was there any noise?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. He guggled at the throat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Give an account of any other circumstances that you

<p class='c000'>Q. Where did you go to from thence?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I went below stairs about my work. My work lay
below stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. How long afterwards was it before you saw Mr.
Donellan?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It might be about a quarter of an hour. I saw him in
the passage. Mr. Donellan said, Sir Theodosius was out very
late over night a fishing, that it was very silly of him, as he
had been taking such physick as he had been taking of, before
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. That is before that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did he give any reason why he had been out so late
a fishing?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did he say any thing more at that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you see Mr. Donellan the day that the body was

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What did Mr. Donellan say at that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. He said there was nothing the matter, that it was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_247'>a_247</span>blood-vessel had broke which had occasioned Sir Theodosius’s
death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did Mr. Donellan bring any thing to you at or about

<p class='c000'>A. No.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. At any time before his death?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, nothing at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did he never bring you any thing for any purpose?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was any thing brought to you by Mr. Donellan within
a fortnight or three weeks before the death of Sir Theodosius
Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No.</p>

for upon this melancholy occasion?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. On the 9th of September; I think it was on a Saturday.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='que'></a>Q. Who did you receive a message from at that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I really do not know; I received a message by some
strange round-about way, in consequence of which I went,
but I don’t know who sent it. Mr. Wilmer and I went in
company; we met Mr. Bucknill, Mr. Powell, of Rugby,
and Mr. Snow, of Southam; those were all the physical
people I believe. Mr. Bucknill opened the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. <a id='whe'></a>Where did you meet at that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. In the church-yard at Newbold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. The body had then been interred?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It had been in the vault at Newbold as I understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What passed at that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We proceeded to the opening of the body as soon as
we conveniently could, and inspected as far as we were able
the appearances of the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What were the material appearances that struck you
at that time?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The material appearances where, in the first place,
the body appeared upon a general view swoln or distended a
good deal; the face of a round figure extremely black, with
the lips swelled and retracted and shewing the gums; the
teeth black except a small white speck on one of the fore
teeth; the tongue <a id='pro3'></a>protruding beyond the fore teeth, and
turning upwards towards the nose; the blackness descended
upon the throat, gradually diminishing as it got towards the
breast, and the body was spotted in many parts but not very
material. There was another circumstance which for decency
I have omitted, but if called upon I am ready to mention.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_249'>a_249</span><i>Mr. Balguy.</i> That circumstance is not at all material.
I meant to ask you merely to such appearances as were material.
Were there any appearances upon the body sufficient
to cause or confirm an opinion you may by and by give upon
the subject?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We proceeded to open the body, and in dissecting
the skin the fat appeared in a dissolving state a little watery;
on getting into the cavity of the belly the bowels in the lower
belly seemed to put on the appearance of inflammation. I
choose to make use of the valgar term <em>appearance</em>, in order
to convey a general idea of the appearance things in that
state generally put on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was it so with the stomach too?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes: the orifices of the stomach and the small arch
of the stomach; the heart upon opening the pericardium,
the membrane which encloses it, appeared to be in a natural
state; the lungs appeared what I call suffused with blood,
looking red and spotted in many places with black specks;
and on the back part the blood had settled in a deep red colour,
almost approaching to purple; the diaphragm was in
the same state, and in general upon the depending surfaces
of the body the blood was settled in the like manner; the
kidneys appeared black as tinder, and the liver much in the
same state. These I think are most of the appearances I
need mention upon the present occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you heard the evidence of Mr. Powell, the
apothecary?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. And have heard too the evidence of Lady Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Now from the evidence of Mr. Powell and the evidence
of Lady Boughton, independent of appearances, for I
would have you forget them for the present instant; what
was in your judgment the occasion of Sir Theodosius Boughton’s
death?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Independent of the appearances of the body, I am of
opinion that the draught, in consequence of the symptoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_250'>a_250</span>which succeeded the swallowing of it, as described by Lady
Boughton, was poison; and the immediate cause of his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Please to smell upon that bottle; what in your judgment
is the noxious medicine in that bottle?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I know the liquid well; it is a distillation of laurel
leaves, commonly called laurel water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You have heard Mr. Powell’s account of the mixture
he prepared for Sir Theodosius Boughton; was the mixture
innocent and proper?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. In my opinion it was perfectly innocent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You have said that in your judgment laurel water is
contained in this bottle?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you made any particular experiments upon the
effects of laurel water?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have several.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You will please to relate the particular experiments
you have made, and the appearances in consequence of those
experiments?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Mr. Wilmer and I made experiments together; our
first experiment with laurel water was upon a middle sized
dog; I held his mouth open and there was I believe nearly
two ounces of laurel water poured down his throat. I held
the dog between my knees: in half a minute as nearly as I
can guess, he dropped dead to the ground without any motion,
except a tremulous motion once or twice of the lower
jaw. The next animal on which I tried the laurel water was
likewise in company with Mr. Wilmer. To an aged mare,
we gave at repeated intervals out of an horn, I believe
about a pint and an half of laurel water In about two minutes
she was precipitated to the ground with her head under
her, and then tumbled on her back kicking violently;
she afterwards lay without kicking but seemed convulsed,
her eyes rolling about, rearing up her head as if in agonies,
gulping at her stomach as if something lay there exceeding
offensive to her; and at that instant and during the whole
time she lived afterwards, heaving in the flanks in a most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_251'>a_251</span>extraordinary manner, and at the end of fifteen minutes she
expired. After this in company with Mr. Ewbank of Coventry,
I gave to a cat about a spoonful of laurel water
which I had myself seen distilled; it was pale and limpid as
pure distilled waters, and seemed very weak. The cat
though I believe she had not half the quantity I intended she
should have taken, died in three minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What quantity did you pour down the cat’s throat?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. About a spoonful, about half an ounce. At Southam,
the beginning of this week, I gave in presence of Mr. Snow,
to another aged horse, about a pint of laurel water, distilled
by Mr. Snow. Upon his receiving into his stomach the first
horn full, which was a small one, no bigger than we used in
the former experiment, he dropped to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Court.</i> What was the quantity that horn held?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I suppose three or four ounces. It was impossible to
give the animal the whole of it, full half was spilt. I conceived
it to be very strong, and desired Mr. Snow would give
her no more at that time, in order to try the strength of it.
The horse dropped; he endeavoured to raise himself up, but
could rise no farther than by setting himself upon his buttocks
like a dog. I perceived he had entirely lost the use of
his hinder parts. We then gave him another horn full,
which in its turn knocked him down very soon, and at intervals
we gave him several horns full to the amount of above a
pint in the whole, and at the end of twenty-eight minutes
he expired, violently convulsed, groaning, his tongue lolling
out of his mouth; and indeed the first horse’s tongue
had a very extraordinary appearance, for it darted backward
and forward in the manner of a dart, but this horse lolled
his tongue out like a dog when running. In both the horses
the artery in the neck beat much, even after the animal had
ceased to breathe, except we call the motion of the lower
jaw, a kind of gasping, breathing. I saw all the bodies
opened, and in all of them there was a violent distention of
the veinous system, of the whole veins in the body, the stomach,
bowels, lungs, and so on. The veins were distended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_252'>a_252</span>and full of blood, the lungs appeared red and suffused. I
said before that I did not use the term <em>inflammation</em> in any
other way than to convey the vulgar idea the appearance of
red colour given to any part by blood. The lungs suffused
with blood looking very red, and in the first horse it was of
the colour of a deep pink; very different I conceive from
the natural colour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You have smelled to the bottle which has the laurel
water in it, do you know any smell in medicine that corresponds
in smell with that mixture?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do not know any medicine that smells like it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Does the smell described by Lady Boughton, something
like bitter almonds, convey to you an idea of that mixture?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It does, and I have given the laurel water to many
people to smell to, and they always described the smell
to be something like bitter almonds. I do not exactly
know how they expressed themselves, but they meant to
say that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. In your judgment is the quantity that one of these
bottles contains of laurel water sufficient to take away life
from any human creature?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. In my opinion it is.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. I have now got your opinion upon the subject, independent
of any appearances you observed upon the body of
Sir Theodosius Boughton. Now are you from these appearances
confirmed, or otherwise, in the opinion you have given?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Confirmed in it so far as upon viewing a body so long
after the death of the subject one can be allowed to form a
judgment upon such appearances.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Dr. Rattray.</i> Cross-examined by Mr. Newnham.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. If I do not misunderstand you, Doctor, the last account
you gave in answer to the question, Whether you are
confirmed in this opinion by the appearance; you said Yes,
so far as you might be allowed to form an opinion viewing the
body so long after the death of the subject?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_253'>a_253</span>A. Yes; so far as we may be allowed to form a judgment
upon appearances so long after death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. By your putting it in that way, do you, or do you
not mean to say that all judgment upon such a subject, in
such a case, is unfounded?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I cannot say that, because from the analogy between
the appearances in that body, and those distinguishable in
animals killed by the poison I have just mentioned, I think
them so much alike that I am rather confirmed in my opinion
with respect to the operation of the draught.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Those bodies were instantaneously opened?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes, so much so that there was the peristaltick motion
of the bowels upon their being pricked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. This was upon the eleventh day after Sir Theodosius’s
death?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What was the appearance of the body when you first
went to Lawford Hall?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. At the first time I saw the body, what I did see of it
was, the face was in the condition I have described, with a
maggot crawling over its surface, it was black as I have
described, it was quite in the same state; in short, I saw
no difference the last day, excepting that the maggot was
not upon it then.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Were you or not offended by a violent stench as you
approached the dead body?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We were.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Had not putrefaction considerably taken place?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I believe it had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Does not putrefaction increase very much in the space
of five or six days, in a hot summer?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I should think it must certainly increase.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was or not the body, in a very high state of putrefaction
when you saw it?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Upon the shroud being removed, the body appeared
to me much fairer than I expected; I expected to have seen
it in a very black putrified state, but the external appearance
was not quite so highly so, as I expected.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_254'>a_254</span>Q. You mentioned that the body was much swelled?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It was swelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Appearing upon a gangrene, I suppose?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It rather put on the appearance of gangrene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. I understand you have set your name to a description
of certain appearances that met your eye when you examined
the body—I mean your examination?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you, or did you not, concur with Mr. Wilmer as
to the appearances of the body?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. In general we did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You set your name to that examination?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did not set my name to any thing but my own examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Wherein the appearances are particularly described?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. They are not particularly described, there is something
said about the stomach and bowels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. For what purpose then did you attend there?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did not know that it was necessary before a coroner’s
jury to enter into the particulars; I was quite a novice
in the business.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Do you mean a novice in the mode of dissection.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, in the business before a coroner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did the account you set your name to, contain a true
description of the appearances that met your eye upon the
occasion?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. So far as they went it did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you ever hear or know of any poison whatever
occasioning any immediate external appearances on the human
body?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, no immediate external appearances in the case
of vegetable poisons, except what I have heard, but they
have not fallen under my own knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. So far for the external appearance. Now I shall be
glad to know whether all the appearances you speak of in
the face, the protuberance of the tongue, and the lips being
swelled and retracted, whether those are not all signs of putrefaction?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_255'>a_255</span>A. I really don’t know that they are.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. I do not mean to give you any offence, but I beg
leave to ask whether you have been much used to anatomical
dissection?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have been as far as persons not particularly intended
for anatomical pursuits—I am not a professor of anatomy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you ever attend the dissection of a human body
that was poisoned, or suspected to have been poisoned?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Never.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. From the external appearances of the different parts
of the body you draw no kind of conclusion or inference,
and form no opinion?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, I don’t form any strong opinion from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. How were the appearances when the cavity of the abdomen
was opened?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have described them in general.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Not being an anatomical man it has slipped my memory,
will you please to repeat it?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I believe I did not before mention the omentum or
caul, that was suffused with blood of a brownish red, the
stomach and bowels appeared in general red, which is vulgarly
called an inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Might not that be owing to a transfusion of the blood?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Rattray.</i> From what cause?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Newnham.</i> From putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Rattray.</i> Do you, by a transfusion of the blood,
mean the passage of the blood from the arteries into the veins?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Newnham.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Rattray.</i> I cannot think it could arise from putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. That is your opinion?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It is.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you look at the stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. As Sir Theodosius Boughton is represented to have
died in a few minutes after taking this medicine, did you
with correctness and attention examine the stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The contents of the stomach were about a spoonful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_256'>a_256</span>and an half, or a couple of ounces of a slimy reddish liquor,
which I rubbed between my finger and thumb, and it contained
no gritty substance that I could perceive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is it not usual to find some such quantity of liquor in
the stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The stomach after death must contain something
more or less according to different circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You said the stomach and the orifice of it and the
small arch of it bore the appearance of inflammation; pray
is not inflammation and appearance of inflammation much
the same thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. All that I have to say upon the present business is I
perhaps don’t know the cause of inflammation; but there is
an appearance of inflammation upon the stomach and bowels,
owing to an injection of blood into the veinous system, the
veins being full of blood, put on a red appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. If you will not take upon you to say what is the cause,
what are the signs of inflammation?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. An appearance of redness, sometimes but not always
attended with pain, and sometimes throbbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you pursue your search through the bowels?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No; I <a id='can'></a>cannot say I did, nor did I think it in my
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. How far did you pursue your search in the stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We examined the contents of the stomach; we took
the stomach out, but in taking it out a great part of the contents
issued out of the bowels next to it; and the smell was
so offensive I did not choose to enter into that matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Whether a pursuit or enquiry, from an inspection
through the bowels, was not as likely to have led to a discovery
of the cause of the death, as any other part of the
body which you did examine?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do not believe a pursuit through the whole extent
of the bowels could have led to any discovery in these circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Are not the bowels the seat of poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. When it passes in there, no doubt it affects the
bowels.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_257'>a_257</span>Q. Then why did you not examine into the contents of
the bowels?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did not think it in the power of any one to examine
into the contents of the bowels; their contents being so
strong and disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Whether you do not form your judgment upon the
appearances?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Not altogether; they corroborate my opinion upon
the effect of the draught.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you or did you not know the contents of the
draught Mr. Powell had prepared when you was examined
before the coroner?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes; I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. And you knew from the account given you how long
Sir Theodosius Boughton lived after he took that draught?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I took my information from Lady Boughton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Then whether many reasons have not occurred, subsequent
to that time, considerably, to induce you to form
your judgment that he died of arsenick?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Not subsequent to that time; at that time I did
think he died of arsenick; but I am now clear that I was
then mistaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Why may you not be mistaken now?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I cannot conceive that in these circumstances any
one can be mistaken as to the medicine; from the sensible
qualities described by Lady Boughton, I believe it to be of
that nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did not you know at that time the symptoms described
by Lady Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Then was not your judgment at that time as ripe for
information as it is now?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It is now since I have received the information.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Whether you did not, after you heard Lady Boughton
describe the symptoms, and after you saw the body
opened, give it as your opinion that he died of arsenick?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have had such an opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_258'>a_258</span>Q. And have declared so?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was there or was there not a large quantity of extravasated
blood in the thorax?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. On each side the lungs there was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. About what quantity?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I think not quite a pint on each side the right and
left lobe of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Would not the rupture of a blood vessel occasion
death?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The rupture of a blood vessel undoubtedly would
have occasioned death; but it would not in my apprehension
have been attended with the same appearances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Might not a blood vessel in an effort to reach be
broken?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I should conceive, that if, in an effort to reach, a
blood vessel of that magnitude had ruptured that he must
have died immediately without convulsions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. But supposing a person recovering from convulsions,
for he is stated to be inclined to sleep?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It is a case I am not supposing probable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is it possible?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Every thing is possible under God.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you never hear of any person dying of an epilepsy
or of an apoplexy with symptoms like those, being in convulsions?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do not think the symptoms described as having
taken place in Sir Theodosius Boughton are like to an epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Nor an apoplexy?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. They were entirely in my opinion the effects of the
draught.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Might not an epilepsy or an apoplexy be accompanied
with those symptoms?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I never saw either of them attended with an heaving
at the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When respiration grows feeble; is it not a common
case that the muscles of the throat are very much relaxed?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_259'>a_259</span>A. All the effects that succeeded the draught I believe
were the consequences of it; and if the muscles were relaxed
or foam proceeded from the mouth, they were in consequence
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is it not commonly the case with persons who die of
almost every disorder?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Very often.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Are not the muscles of the throat instrumental in
respiration?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. So far as to the passage of the air in and out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is it not a very common appearance a few minutes
before death, when respiration grows feeble for froth to
issue from the mouth?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, not commonly. I have seen it in epilepsies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What was your reason for supposing at one time that
the deceased died of arsenick?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Every man is mistaken now and then in his opinion,
and that was my case; I am not ashamed to own a mistake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you been very nice in your experiments; for
instance, in the conveying the laurel-water into the animals?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. If there was any want of nicety the subject had less
of it than I intended.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When an animal, suppose a dog or cat, is striving to
refuse a draught you are forcing into its mouth, whether it
is not common for some part of the liquor to get into the
lungs?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. If it did it would make it cough, but be attended
with no bad consequences unless it was poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you ever convey poison immediately into the
stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Rattray.</i> Do you mean by perforation through the
ribs?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Newnham.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Rattray.</i> I never have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you ever convey any into the veins of an animal?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I never have.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_260'>a_260</span>Q. Did you observe or smell that liquor which came out
of the stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I could not avoid smelling it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Had it the same offensive smell?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It in general had; one could not expect any smell
but partaking of that general putrefaction of the body; but
I had a particular taste in my mouth at that time, a kind of
biting acrimony upon my tongue. And I have in all the experiments
I have made with laurel-water, always had the
same taste, from breathing over the water, a biting upon
my tongue, and sometimes a bitter taste upon the upper
part of the fauces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you impute it to that cause then?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, I imputed it to the volatile salts escaping the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Were not the volatile salts likely to occasion that?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No. I complained to Mr. Wilmer, “I have a very
odd taste in my mouth, my gums bleed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You attributed it to the volatility of the salts?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. At that time I could not account for it, but in my experiments
afterwards with the laurel-water, the effluvia of it
has constantly and uniformly produced the same kind of
taste; there is a very volatile oil in it I am confident.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Do not you understand that there cannot be any information
at all obtained in consequence of dissecting animals
which have been destroyed by laurel-water?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do not think that the operation of these sort of substances
upon the inside of the stomach produce any violent
appearances of redness, but in most of the animals I have
seen there has been small red spots inside, of the size of a
shilling perhaps, but the effect in the trials I have made has
been a driving the blood from the part of the body where it
should be. I believe the effect of the poison is to empty the
arteries in general, and push the blood into the veins; that is
my opinion at present, so far as I have gone into the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. But you was mistaken at first relative to forming an
opinion that the death was occasioned by arsenick?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_261'>a_261</span><i>Mr. Balguy.</i> You say that when the shroud came to be
taken off the body you found the body less offensive than you
had expected?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Less black.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When you first saw the body on the 4th of September,
did you or not take the shroud off?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We did not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You saw nothing but the face?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Nothing but the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. If at that time Captain Donellan had insinuated to you
any suspicion of poison, whether you would or not have
taken the shroud from the body?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I verily believe, had I known the tendency of the
enquiry, I should have sat there for a month rather than
have left the body unopened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Should you at that time if the suspicion had been disclosed
have proceeded to open the body?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I should have attended the opening of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Newnham.</i> I understand you to say that when the
body was opened, the external appearances did not contribute
in any way to your forming a judgment one way or other?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Nobody would attempt to form a judgment upon the
external appearances altogether.</p>

    <div>Mr. <i>Bradford Wilmer</i> sworn. Examined by Mr. Wheeler.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. You was sent for to Lawford-hall at the same time
Dr. Rattray was?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I was; I went there with Dr. Rattray.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When first you came there did you see Captain Donellan?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did. He desired us to walk into the parlour; after
we had had some refreshment we were told that the coffin
was unsoldered, and we were desired to walk up stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was any thing said to you at that time as to the means
by which Sir Theodosius Boughton had died?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Not the least in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_262'>a_262</span>Q. Nothing said of poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I never heard a word of poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. When you did go up stairs, what part did you see of
the corpse?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Only the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. We have learned from Dr. Rattray that you did not
proceed any farther, how happened that?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The body was so extremely putrid, that I declared
my opinion to Dr. Rattray that the proposed enquiry could
give no sort of information.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Supposing it had been communicated to you that Sir
Theodosius Boughton had died by poison, should you have
been satisfied without opening it?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I should then have opened the body at all events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You did not then open the body?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I certainly did not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You afterwards did open it at the time Dr. Rattray
has spoken of?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I was present at the opening of the body, by Mr.
Bucknill.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you been employed in any experiments with
Dr. Rattray?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Without going into every particular of Dr. Rattray’s
account, do you and he concur in general as to the effect of
that medicine?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I wish you would be more particular in that question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Do you agree with Dr. Rattray in what he has said
respecting those experiments at which you was present?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do in general; but as Dr. Rattray has not described
the appearances which were visible upon the dissection of
the horse, with your lordship’s permission I will read my
minutes. “On the 20th of March, one ounce of the laurel
water was given to a young greyhound; while Dr. Rattray
held the mouth open, I poured the water into the dog’s
throat; as soon as it was swallowed the Doctor released its
head to observe the effects of the poison, when, to our great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_263'>a_263</span>surprise, he fell down upon his side, and without the least
struggle or any perceptible motion (except what the doctor
has explained about the dropping of the lower jaw) expired.
On the 22d of March, in the presence of Sir William
Wheeler, a pint and a quarter of laurel-water was given to
a mare aged twenty-eight years. Within a minute from the
time it was swallowed she seemed affected; her flanks were
observed to heave much, and a trembling seized her limbs;
in two minutes she suddenly fell down upon her head, and
in a short time after was very violently convulsed; the convulsions
continued about five minutes, at the expiration of
which time, she laid still, but her breathing was very quick
and laborious, and her eyes much affected with spasms. At
this time four ounces more of the water were given her,
after which she seemed much weaker, but without any more
return of convulsions, and in about fifteen minutes from the
time of her first seizure, she expired.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. After her first convulsion she was quieter?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. She was. “Upon opening the abdomen, a strong
smell of laurel-water was perceptible; the colon, one of the
large intestines, was not altered from its usual appearance,
but the small intestines appeared of a purple colour, and
the veins were much distended with blood; the stomach contained
some hay mixed with laurel water; its internal surface
was not inflamed, except in a small degree near the
lower orifice of the stomach; the lungs appeared remarkably
full of blood; the small vessels upon their surface being as
visible as if they had been injected with red wax.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Whether you in general concur in sentiments with
Dr. Rattray, as to the effect of laurel-water?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Wilmer.</i> Do you mean upon the human body, or
upon brutes?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Wheeler.</i> Upon both.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It has in four instances been fatal in the human body;
I do not know it of my own knowledge, but from my reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you any doubt of its being fatal?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_264'>a_264</span>A. Not the least in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Now do you apprehend the quantity contained in that
bottle is sufficient to take away life?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I imagine one bottle of that size full of laurel-water,
would be sufficient to kill in half an hour’s time any man in
this court.</p>

    <div>Mr. <i>Bradford Wilmer</i>. Cross-examined by Mr. Green.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. Were there any symptoms in this case peculiarly different
from the symptoms attending a case of epilepsy or
apoplexy?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The appearance of the body in the putrid state in
which it was when I had an opportunity of observing it,
could give me no information to form an opinion upon respecting
the cause of the death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you had any opportunities in your own experience
of observing epilepsies?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have. They are of two kinds, either primary or
symptomatick. It happens sometimes that without the least
previous notice, a man in the most perfect state of health,
in the midst of pleasure or engaged in business, as Suetonius
says of Julius Cæsar, may in a moment, be seized with the
epilepsy, his senses will leave him, he will fall down, be
convulsed, foam at the mouth, his tongue will be black, and
he either may die or recover. As to the symptomatick epilepsy,
I can speak from experience: a patient of mine had
a violent pain and tumour in his finger; as soon as the pain,
which gradually went up his arm, reached his arm-pit, he
fell down epileptick, and convulsed. But if previous to an
<a id='epi'></a>epilepsy, the patient heave very much at the stomach, and
shew signs of sickness, I should conclude the cause of that
epilepsy was in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Epilepsies proceed from various causes?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Numerous causes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Will not the loss of blood occasion an epilepsy?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I believe not.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_265'>a_265</span>Q. What quantity of blood was there in the stomach?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did not measure it; I conclude about two pints; it
lodged in the cavity of the thorax.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Might not that occasion convulsions?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do not know; but if I might be allowed to reason
from analogy, I should conclude it would, for in all slaughtered
animals, when the blood runs out from them in a full
stream, they lie quiet, but they never die without convulsions.
The loss of blood will evidently occasion convulsions.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Wheeler.</i> From the appearances of the body, and
after the evidence you have heard given both by Lady Boughton
and the other witnesses, what do you attribute this gentleman’s
death to?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. After having heard Lady Boughton’s evidence, and
therefore being acquainted with the symptoms which preceded
the death of Sir Theodosius Boughton, I am clearly of
opinion that his death was occasioned by a poisonous draught
administered to him by Lady Boughton on the morning of
his death.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Court.</i> Is the heaving in the stomach or the belly a circumstance
which attends an epilepsy?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It is not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You are a Physician and live at Birmingham?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You have heard the evidence that has been given?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What in your judgment was the cause of the death
of Sir Theodosius Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I think he died in consequence of taking that draught,
after the taking of which he was seized in so extraordinary
a manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Mention the particular reasons you have for thinking so?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It does not appear, from any part of the evidence that
has been this day given, that the late Sir Theodosius had any
disease upon him of a nature either likely or in a degree sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_266'>a_266</span>to produce those violent consequences which happened
to him, neither do I know in nature any medicine, properly
so called, which administered in any dose, and in any form,
could possibly produce the same effects. I know nothing
but a poison speedy in its operation that could be attended
with such terrible consequences: As to the appearances of
the body upon dissection they were certainly, as far as could
be collected at that distant period from the time of the death,
and in such hot weather, similar to those appearances which
are found in the bodies of animals that are killed by poisons
collected from vegetable substances, not from mineral ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Will you please to look at that phial?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The vehicle of it is laurel-water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Would that quantity be sufficient to cause death?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do not know how this is distilled, or how firm it
may be, but I know it may be made in this quantity to
destroy animal life in a few seconds. I do not know who
distilled this, but I have made it frequently myself, and in
such a degree of strength as to destroy animal life in a few
seconds; if it is distilled enough to collect the essential oil,
a tea-spoonful of it would destroy animal life in a few seconds.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Court.</i> If it was made on purpose?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Certainly; I dare say as strong a poison might be
made from bitter almonds as that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Do you or not, from the evidence you have heard,
believe Sir Theodosius Boughton died of poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I do.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Court.</i> You are not to give your opinion from the evidence
in general, but upon the symptoms those witnesses have described?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. By the symptoms those evidences have described, I
am of opinion that Sir Theodosius Boughton died of poison.</p>

    <div><i>Dr. Parsons</i> sworn. Examined by Mr. Howorth.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. You are I believe professor of anatomy in the university
of Oxford?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I am.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_267'>a_267</span>Q. You have heard the symptoms attending the death of
Sir Theodosius Boughton described by the witnesses produced
to-day?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. What in your judgment occasioned the death of Sir
Theodosius Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. From the description of the state of the young Baronet’s
health, previous to his taking the second dose, which
was supposed to be similar to that which he had taken two
or three days before, and from the violent nervous symptoms
that immediately followed the taking thereof, it is my opinion
that he died in consequence of taking the second dose;
which instead of being a composition of jalap and rhubarb
only, proved to contain a poison, and of what nature that
poison was, appears sufficiently from the description that Lady
Boughton gives of its smell when she poured it out in order
to give it to her son; her ladyship said it smelt like the taste
of bitter almonds, which particularly characterises the smell
of laurel-water. Perhaps it may not be improper to produce
some laurel-water for the jury to smell at, that they may
judge how well it agrees with the description that Lady
Boughton has given of the supposed physick. The violent
nervous symptoms that came on subsequent to his taking the
second dose took place so soon, and were so different from
what attended the taking of the first, that undoubtedly they
were caused by something it had in it very different from the
contents of the first, much more active, and as it proved
more deleterious. Jalap sometimes disagrees with the stomach
and may produce sickness, but with respect to Sir
Theodosius Boughton this medicine did not create any sickness
when given the first time.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Court.</i> Could all the ingredients in the medicine mentioned
by Mr. Powell produce in Sir Theodosius Boughton
the effects described?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No; I apprehend they could not; and as a proof of
it, they did not produce any such effects in the first instance,
or dose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_268'>a_268</span>Q. Are the symptoms which have been described by
Lady Boughton such as would attend an epilepsy, or is there
any and what difference?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The epilepsy is distinguished by a total abolition of
sense, but an increase of motion in several of the muscles,
so that the patient will appear much convulsed, and seems
to see and hear every thing that is said and done, and to observe
whatever is passing; yet when the fit goes off he has
no knowledge or recollection of what has happened. Apoplexy
is a sudden privation of all the powers of sense, and
voluntary motion: the person affected seeming to be in a
profound sleep, accompanied with considerable noise in
breathing. As so little therefore is said of convulsions as a
part of Sir Theodosius’s symptoms, the state in which he lay
seems to have been more of the apoplectick kind than epileptick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. It has been described by Lady Boughton that soon
after taking this draught the stomach heaved very much, and
a noise could be perceived as issuing from it; now is that in
your judgment to be attributed to either epilepsy or apoplexy,
or the effect of the medicine?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The effects of the medicine I think undoubtedly, and
not spontaneous epilepsy or apoplexy; it is very immaterial
whether you call the symptoms epileptick or apoplectick;
for which ever they resembled most I consider them but as
symptomatick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Was the heaving of the stomach the effect of apoplexy
or epilepsy, or of this draught?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No doubt, I think the draught was the cause, especially
as laurel-water, which the draught seems to have contained
from its peculiar smell, will produce similar effects.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Then your judgment is, that the fatal effects were
produced by the medicine thus taken?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I think there can be no doubt of that as they commenced
almost as soon as he swallowed the draught; and a
mixture such as he is supposed to have taken, is known to
have the power of producing them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_269'>a_269</span>Q. And from your knowledge of the effects produced by
laurel water, your opinion is that laurel-water was the poison
thus administered to Sir Theodosius Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It is. Dr. Rutty relates a case of a girl of eighteen
years of age and in perfect health, who took a quantity, less
than two spoons full of the first runnings of simple water of
laurel leaves; whereupon within half a minute she fell down,
was convulsed, foamed at the mouth, and died in a short time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Could those effects be produced (speak from your
own judgment) by laurel-water?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have no doubt of it. Dogs and other quadrupeds
(as we are informed) that take it, fall immediately into totterings
and convulsions of the limbs, which are presently
followed by a total paralysis; these convulsions, with some
additional circumstances, as foaming at the mouth and loss
of sense, constitute the epilepsy which is described among
the effects of vegetable poisons.</p>

    <div>Dr. <i>Parsons</i> cross-examined by Mr. Newnham.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. From the appearances of health in Sir Theodosius
Boughton, and from the medicine not having occasioned any
bad symptoms before, you conclude his death was occasioned
by some other medicine substituted instead of that or in addition
to it?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Most certainly; especially as the smell of it bespoke
its having received the addition of a very poisonous ingredient.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you never known instances of persons being
taken suddenly when engaged in pleasure or business, or at
dinner, dying convulsed, epileptick, or apoplectick?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have; but those who die suddenly of apoplexy are
generally persons of a full habit; and who are neither so thin
nor so young as Sir Theodosius Boughton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you never known instances of persons of a thin
habit being attacked by an apoplexy or an epilepsy?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. By epilepsy they may.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you never heard of a person having the appearance
of perfect health being seized with an epilepsy without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_270'>a_270</span>any primary cause giving any warning, have you never heard
of people in perfect health being seized with an epilepsy or
apoplexy?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes; apoplexy proceeding from repletion or the sudden
bursting of a blood-vessel; epilepsy may proceed from
a variety of causes partial or general, in the head or elsewhere;
but very seldom I believe proves so suddenly fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Might not those have happened to Sir Theodosius
Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. There can be no doubt of the possibility of their attacking
him, but I think there is no reason to go so far for a
cause as to <em>possibility</em>, when this medicine as all the world
knows will effect it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. That is assuming as a fact that he took two ounces of
laurel-water?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. A much less quantity would be sufficient for the purpose,
if we may credit Dr. Rutty’s account.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You collect that from the similarity of the smell?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We have nothing else to judge from but the similarity
of the smell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is not that the case with a variety of things; will not
black cherry-water have that smell?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Black cherry-water is said to have the same smell,
but it is now out of use; I don’t suppose there is an apothecary
in the island who has it, and therefore it could not be
substituted by accident for the other vehicle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Will not bitter almonds have that smell?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes; and spirits flavoured with them are said to be
poisonous to the human species.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You ground your opinion upon the description of its
smell by Lady Boughton?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Yes; we can ground our opinion upon nothing else
but that and the subsequent effects.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you heard the evidence that has been given by
these gentlemen?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have been present the whole time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you hear Lady Boughton’s evidence?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I heard the whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you attend to the symptoms her ladyship
described, as appearing upon Sir Theodosius Boughton,
after the medicine was given him?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Can any certain inference upon physical or chirurgical
principles be drawn from those symptoms, or from the
appearances externally or internally of the body, to enable
you, in your judgment to decide, that the death was occasioned
by poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I was in London then, a gentleman who is in Court
waited upon me with a copy of the examination of Mr.
Powell and Lady Boughton, and on account of the dissection,
and the physical gentlemen’s opinion upon that dissection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. I don’t wish to go into that, I put my question in a
general way?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. The whole appearances upon the dissection, explain
nothing but putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You have been long in the habit of dissecting human
subjects? I presume you have dissected more than any man
in Europe?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I have dissected some thousands during these thirty-three
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Are those appearances you have heard described,
such in your judgment, as are the result of putrefaction in
dead subjects?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Entirely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Are the symptoms that appeared after the medicine
was given, such as necessarily conclude that the person had
taken poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Certainly not.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_272'>a_272</span>Q. If an apoplexy had come on, would not the symptoms
have been nearly or somewhat similar?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Very much the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you ever known or heard of a young subject
dying of an apoplectic or epileptic fit?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Certainly; but with regard to the apoplexy not so
frequent, young subjects will perhaps die more frequently
of epilepsies than old ones; children are dying every day
from teething, which is a species of epilepsy arising from an
irritation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Did you ever in your practice, know an instance of
laurel-water being given to a human subject?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, never.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is any certain analogy to be drawn from the effects of
any species of poison upon an animal of the brute creation,
to that it may have upon a human subject?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. As far as my experience goes, which is not a very
confined one, because I have poisoned some thousands of
animals, they are very nearly the same, opium for instance
will poison a dog similar to a man; arsenic will have very
near the same effect upon a dog, as it would have, I take it
for granted, upon a man; I know something of the effects
of them, and I believe their operations will be nearly similar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q, Are there not many things which kill animals almost
instantaneously, that will have no detrimental or noxious
effect upon a human subject; spirits, for instance, occur to me?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I apprehend a great deal depends upon the mode of
experiment; no man is fit to make one, but those who have
made many, and paid considerable attention to all the
circumstances that relate to experiments, it is a common
experiment which I believe seldom fails, and it is in the
mouth of every body, that a little brandy will kill a cat:
I have made the experiment, and have killed several cats,
but it is a false experiment; in all those cases where it kills
the cat, it kills the cat by getting into her lungs, not into
her stomach, because, if you convey the same quantity of
brandy, or three times as much into the stomach, in such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_273'>a_273</span>way as the lungs shall not be affected, the cat will not die;
now in those experiments that are made by forcing an
animal to drink, there are two operations going on, one is a
refusing the liquor, by the animal, its kicking and working
with its throat, to refuse it, the other is a forcing the liquor
upon the animal, and there are very few operations of that
kind, but some of the liquor gets into the lungs. I have
known it from experience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. If you had been called upon to dissect a body,
suspected to have died of poison, should you or not have
thought it necessary to have pursued your search through
the guts?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Certainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Do you not apprehend that you would have been
more likely to receive information from thence than any
other part of the frame?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. That is the track of the poison, and I should certainly
have followed that track through.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. You have heard of the froth issuing from Sir Theodosius’s
mouth, a minute or two before he died, is that
peculiar to a man dying of poison, or is it not very common
in many other complaints?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I fancy it is a general effect, of people dying in what
you may call health, in an apoplexy, or epilepsy, in all
sudden deaths, where the person was a moment before that
in perfect health.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Have you ever had an opportunity of seeing such
appearances upon such subjects?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Hundreds of times.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Should you consider yourself bound, by such an
appearance, to impute the death of the subject to poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. No, certainly not; I should rather suspect an
apoplexy, and I wish in this case, the head had been opened
to remove all doubts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. If the head had been opened, do you apprehend all
doubts would have been removed?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. It would have been still farther removed, because,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_274'>a_274</span>although the body was putrid, so that one could not tell
whether it was a recent inflammation, yet an apoplexy arises
from an extravasation of blood in the brain, which would
have laid in a coagulum. I apprehend although the body
was putrid, that would have been much more visible than
the effect any poison could have had upon the stomach or
intestines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Then in your judgment upon the appearances the
gentlemen have described no inference can be drawn from
thence that Sir Theodosius Boughton died of poison?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. Certainly not; it does not give the least suspicion.</p>

    <div><i>Mr. John Hunter</i> Cross-examined by <i>Mr. Howorth</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Q. Having heard the account to-day that Sir Theodosius
Boughton, apparently in perfect health, had swallowed a
draught which had produced the symptoms described, I ask
you whether any reasonable man can entertain a doubt that
that draught whatever it was produced those appearances?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. I don’t know well what answer to make to that
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Having heard the account given of the health of this
young gentleman on that morning, previous to taking the
draught, and the symptoms that were produced immediately
upon taking the draught, I ask your opinion as a man of
judgment, whether you don’t think that draught was the
occasion of his death?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. With regard to his being in health, that explains
nothing; we frequently, and indeed generally see the
healthiest people dying suddenly, therefore I shall lay little
stress upon that; as to the circumstances of the draught,
I own they are suspicious, every man is just as good a judge
as I am.</p>

<p class='c000'>Court. You are to give your opinion upon the symptoms
only, not upon any other evidence given.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Howorth.</i> Upon the symptoms immediately produced,
after the swallowing of that draught, I ask whether, in your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_275'>a_275</span>judgment and opinion, that draught did not occasion his
death? A. I can only say, that it is a circumstance in
favour of such an opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Court. That the draught was the occasion of his death?
A. No; because the symptoms afterwards are those of a
man dying, who was before in perfect health; a man dying
of an epilepsy or apoplexy, the symptoms would give one
those general ideas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Court. It is the general idea you are asked about now,
from the symptoms which appeared upon Sir Theodosius
Boughton immediately after he took the draught followed
by his death so very soon after; whether, upon that part
of the case, you are of opinion that the draught was the
occasion of his death? A. If I knew the draught was
poison, I should say, most probably, that the symptoms
arose from that; but when, I don’t know that that draught
was poison, when I consider that a number of other things
might occasion his death, I cannot answer positively to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Court. You recollect the circumstance that was mentioned
of a violent heaving in the stomach? A. All that is the
effect of the voluntary action being lost, and nothing going
on but the involuntary.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Howorth.</i> Then you decline giving any <a id='opi'></a>opinion
upon the subject? A. I don’t form any opinion to myself;
I cannot form an opinion because I can conceive if he had
taken a draught of poison it arose from that; I can conceive
it might arise from other causes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. If you are at all acquainted with the effects and
operations of distilled laurel-water, whether the having
swallowed a draught of that, would not have produced the
symptom described? A. I should suppose it would; I can
only say this of the experiments I have made of laurel-water
upon animals, it has not been near so quick; I have injected
laurel-water directly into the blood of dogs, and they have
not died; I have thrown laurel-water, with a precaution,
into the stomach, and it never produced so quick an effect
with me, as described by those gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_276'>a_276</span>Q. But you admit that laurel-water would have produced
symptoms such as have been described? A. I can conceive
it might.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Newnham.</i> Would not an apoplexy or an epilepsy,
if it had seized Sir Theodosius Boughton at this time,
though he had taken no physic at all, have produced similar
symptoms too? A. Certainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Where a father has died of an apoplexy, is not that
understood, in some measure, to be constitutional? A. There
is no disease whatever, that becomes constitutional, but
what can be given to a child. There is no disease which is
acquired, that can be given to a child; but whatever is
constitutional in the father, the father has a power of giving
that to the children; by which means it becomes what is
called hereditary; there is no such thing as an hereditary
disease; but there is an hereditary disposition for a disease.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Howorth.</i> Do you call apoplexy constitutional?</p>

<p class='c000'>A. We see most diseases are constitutional; the small-pox
is constitutional, though it requires an immediate cause
to produce the effects. The venereal disease is hereditary.
I conceive apoplexy as much constitutional as any disease
whatever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. Is apoplexy likely to attack a thin young man who
had been in a course of taking cooling medicines before?
A. Not so likely, surely, as another man; but I have, in my
account of dissections, two young women dying of apoplexies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Q. But in such an habit of body, particularly attended
with the circumstance of having taken cooling medicines, it
was very unlikely to happen? A. I do not know the nature
of medicines so well as to know that it would hinder an
apoplexy from taking effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Court. Give me your opinion in the best manner you
can, one way or the other, whether upon the whole of the
symptoms described, the death proceeded from that medicine,
or any other cause? A. I do not mean to equivocate, but
when I tell the sentiments of my own mind, what I feel at
the time, I can give nothing decisive.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Dr. Richard Edwards</i> (examined by Mr. Sergt. Lens).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>You are a physician, resident at Falmouth?—I am.</p>

<p class='c000'>How many years have you been in the profession?—About
sixteen years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you recollect being called in, as a physician, to attend
Mrs. Elizabeth Downing upon the 3rd of November?—Yes,
Sir; I was called in between four and five o’clock on the
Monday morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were you in the habit of attending her?—Once before,
at a distant period.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several months before?—More than that.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you came there, and when you were introduced
into the room in which she was, what state did you find her
in?—I was let into the house by Mr. Donnall; I went into
the back room and asked him some questions as to Mrs.
Downing’s illness, and he informed me she had an attack of
Cholera Morbus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did any thing more pass that was material, before you
went into the room where she was?—He told me she had a
similar attack a fortnight before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did any further communication take place?—I asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_278'>a_278</span>him how long she had been ill, and he said she was taken ill
the evening before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did any thing more pass?—Mr. Donnall told me that she
had been at church twice that Sunday.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you then proceed into the room, or did any thing
more pass?—Nothing more passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you went into her room, she was in bed?—Yes, Sir,
she was; I asked some questions of her attendants, before
I spoke to Mrs. Downing; she required some rousing before
she could answer questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were you able to rouse her?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you recollect any thing particular, as to her situation?—I
asked her if she felt any pain, and she said she felt heat
in her stomach, and also cramp in her legs; I then felt her
pulse, and found it a frequent fluttering pulse. I then went
down into the parlour again with Mr. Donnell, and wrote a
prescription.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you make any further inquiries about the state of her
body before you wrote the prescription?—I asked some
questions of Mr. Donnall as to the state of her stomach and
bowels, and he said that she had violent sickness, and that
her bowels were very much relaxed.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this you wrote the prescription?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you at that time form, or could you form, any judgment
of her danger, or that it was likely she would recover?—I
found that she was in very great danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>You had been apprised that she had symptoms of Cholera
Morbus; did you observe any thing of that kind?—No; at
that time she had no sickness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was her state such as to shew that she had?—There was
nothing particular to draw my attention to that being her
state; there was nothing to shew the causes of the disease
at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long did you stay on that occasion?—I suppose
about twenty minutes; I am not certain as to the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you learn from the prisoner whether he himself had
given any medicine?—I understood that he had given an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_279'>a_279</span>opening medicine and an emetic, a saline draught in a state
of effervescence, and also a pill, and some opium mixed
with the saline draught; I believe he told me ten drops of
laudanum.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Is that a large or a small
dose?—It is a small dose.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) Would that only quiet her?—It
was given, he said, to quiet the irritation of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you ever had occasion to attend a person who had
been ill, and who died of Cholera Morbus?—I never had a
patient who died of that disease. There is one circumstance
I would mention: before I left Mr. Donnall, I told him
that as the quantity of active medicine in the prescription
was small, he had better give every three hours, instead of
four hours, as directed in the prescription; and observed at
the same time, that it was given in order to remove something
which I considered to be offensive either in the stomach
or bowels.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of your experience, how soon does Cholera
Morbus produce death?—In general not in less than two
or three days; there may be some instances, but I never
met with one that produced death in less than that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The space of time in this instance was fourteen hours?—Yes,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Can you tell me of any instance that Cholera Morbus
would produce death in so short a time?—I never heard or
knew of any instance of its producing death in so short a
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In your judgment then, and from what you know since,
did this patient die of Cholera Morbus or not?—Certainly
not.</p>

<p class='c000'>You say you staid about twenty minutes?—About that
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>You then took your leave, having given directions about
the prescription, which you took for granted would be
administered afterwards?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you see Mrs. Downing afterwards?—No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_280'>a_280</span>She died at eight o’clock that same morning?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>How soon did you go again after you had heard of her
decease?—I went on the Thursday afternoon to examine
the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you went there, was it to examine the body as to
the cause of the death?—Yes; I was requested by the
Coroner to examine the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>You had heard of the letter that was sent, on suspicion
being awakened?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whom did you meet there?—Mr. Donnall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was there any other person there?—Soon afterwards Mr.
John Street, a surgeon, came there.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another person of the name of Street, a surgeon?—Yes,
Sir; but this was Mr. John Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly afterwards did you go into the room where the
body lay?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did any thing pass before?—Nothing particular.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who went with you?—Mr. John Street and Mr. Donnall;
there was no other medical person present.</p>

<p class='c000'>What did you do?—We took the body from the shell,
and placed it on the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who proceeded to operate on the body?—When the
things were prepared, such as water, &amp;c. I perceived Mr.
Donnall was preparing to operate, with the instruments in
his hands, and turning up the cuffs of his coat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did he proceed?—No; I told him that he was to have
nothing to do with the operation, and I turned to Mr. John
Street and asked him to do it.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Did you say any thing more
to Donnall than that he was to have nothing to do with the
operation?—No, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) Did he (Mr. Street) prepare to
do it?—He objected to it, as not having been in the habit
of operating for a long time.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in the end you were under the necessity of doing it
yourself?—Yes, Sir, with Mr. Street’s occasional assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you opened the body, your particular object was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_281'>a_281</span>the examination of the stomach?—Yes, it was the chief
object of our examination, and we proceeded to do so immediately;
we opened it, and examined it, and poured the
contents into a basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you take out all the contents, or only a part?—The
whole of the contents.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was done with them after they were put into the
basin?—We examined that which was put into the basin
with our fingers, in order to ascertain whether any heavy or
gritty substance had subsided to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) When you say “we,” whom
do you mean besides yourself?—Mr. John Street, my
Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) Donnall did not interfere?—No,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few minutes you examined the bottom?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you find any deposit?—No deposit of any heavy
substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you had done that, what did you do next?—Before
we particularly examined the contents of the stomach,
we examined the state of the stomach, and found it
inflamed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was it a general or partial inflammation?—It was rather
partial; or what we call stellated, or in stars, in different
parts of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were there many? were there several or only one, or
were there two or three?—There were many, in different
parts of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was there any thing else you discovered?—On examining
the villous, or internal coat of the stomach, we found it
softened, and in some parts nearly destroyed by the action
of some corrosive substance. The stellated inflammation
was on the nervous coat, but was very visible through the
villous coat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Are we to understand that the villous coat is, in general,
not so soft? what should its natural state be?—It should
have been much more firm than we found it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_282'>a_282</span>In what way did you examine the villous coat?—With
the nail of my finger, and it easily came off.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in its proper state would it come off easily with the
nail of a finger?—No, Sir. We examined particularly the
under part where the fluid was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was it generally in that soft state?—The greatest part of
it was so.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) The under part is where any
thing in the stomach would rest and would touch?—Yes,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) Did you observe any particularity
in the appearance?—The blood-vessels of the stomach
were rather in a more turgid state than they should be
naturally. We also examined the liver and lungs, and both
appeared in a sound state.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you examine the heart?—I do not recollect; I am
not quite certain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you think that any thing affected it?—I did not
examine it, that I recollect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you give any directions as to what was put into the
basin?—After examining the contents of the stomach,
which were put into the basin, we poured them into an
earthen jug.</p>

<p class='c000'>And your attention was particularly drawn to that in the
basin?—I placed the jug upon a chair, on which there was
a cushion; and I took particular care that, as the seat was
elastic, it should rest against the back, so as not to fall;
and I said at the time that it must be taken particular care
of, as it was necessary for me to examine it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was that said to any one in particular, or was it said
generally?—Particularly to Mr. Donnall; we were very
near each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was there any other person present but you three?—Not
at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) The prisoner, Donnall, was
in the room at that time?—Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) What did you proceed to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_283'>a_283</span>then?—We proceeded to examine the intestines, and found
them also inflamed in different parts, particularly that part
which was next the stomach, and some others that were
lower down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could a patient be sensible of the existence of such an
inflammation, or might it remain for any time, and the
patient be perfectly well?—That is impossible; a patient
could not be well with such an inflammation existing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could you judge at all of the length of time in which,
in the common course of nature, such an inflammation could
be produced by any natural cause? could it be produced by
any natural cause?—Not in the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such an inflammation could be produced by a natural
cause, but not within the time?—Not within the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>What sort of substances will produce that sort of inflammation
in so short a time, not being natural causes?—Any
active poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could it be produced by any thing short of an active
poison in any time, or within so short a time?—I think not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you proceed then to see whether there was any thing
to be discovered of an active nature?—I then turned to the
contents of the stomach which I had placed in a jug.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Then your back had been to
the jug?—It was behind, or rather on my left side.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) When you had turned round, did
you find it in the same situation?—Yes, I found it in the
same situation, but I was surprised to see it empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you express that surprise to any body?—I expressed
it to Mr. Donnall, and asked him what had become of it,
and he told me he had thrown it into the chamber utensil;
I observed to him that he ought not to have done so, as I
had before said that it must be carefully preserved; and I
observed to him also, that it would give me a great deal
more trouble, as I must evaporate a larger quantity of water
than I should otherwise have had to do, to get at the object
of my search.</p>

<p class='c000'>Can you tell us what the quantity was in the basin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_284'>a_284</span>what the quantity was afterwards?—It was a little more than
half a pint originally.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what was the quantity when mixed with the other
water?—Nearly two quarts. The chamber vessel was clean
when I came into the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>What had occasioned any used water in it?—I threw
some of the water into it, in which we had washed some part
of the intestines.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was then done with it?—As soon as we had finished
the examination, I left it to Mr. Street’s charge, who told
me he would take care of the contents of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>You did not see them again till they were at your own
house?—No, not till they were brought there in two bottles.
I recollect putting this chamber utensil further under the
bed, in order that it might not be disturbed, and desired
that no one should touch it or go into the room, during our
absence, Mr. Donnall still remaining. Mr. Donnall had
been out of the room once or twice.</p>

<p class='c000'>But was he there when that direction was given?——Yes,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you afterwards, and when, proceed to examine the
contents of the two bottles?—It was two days before I had
finished that examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>How soon afterwards did you see it in the two bottles
in your house?—On the same day that we examined the
body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you upon examination trace any thing of the sort
that you looked for?—I examined it in different ways by
chemical tests, and they all shewed the presence of arsenic;
if necessary I will state the method I followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In consequence of the experiment, you detected it to be
arsenic?—Arsenic in solution but not in substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>How did you detect it?—I tried it by chemical re-agents
that would produce a certain colour when arsenic was
present.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, upon that part of the subject, what is your
opinion of the cause of the death of this lady, from your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_285'>a_285</span>observation on what you took away and examined afterwards?—From
the appearance of the stomach and the examination
of its contents, I have not the least doubt that it
was produced by poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Independently of that appearance to be arsenic, what is
your opinion of the general appearance, so as to judge of the
cause of the death?—I have no doubt that the death was
produced by the effects of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could you have formed any judgment independently of
the analysis, or is this latter part necessary to your judgment?—I
should have believed, from the examination of the
stomach and intestines only, that the death had been produced
by some corrosive substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should you have been of opinion, without any analysis,
but from the general appearance of the stomach, that she
had died of poison?—I should certainly have been of that
opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>But not arsenic in particular?—No; but some corrosive
substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could that corrosive substance have been produced in the
body itself, or must it have been administered from without?—It
is not possible that it should have been produced internally;
it must have been introduced from without.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sergt. Pell.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I think you said, that you found this lady’s pulse frequent
and fluttering?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>The medicine you prescribed for her was of a purgative
nature?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>How often would she have had to take that medicine,
between the time you gave that prescription and the time
when she died?—I gave her the prescription for every four
hours, but I left instructions to give it every three hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is that the prescription? (<i>shewing it</i>)—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Be so good as to mention what are the materials—or first,
what is the nature of that complaint, called Cholera Morbus?—It
is generally produced in hot seasons, by bile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_286'>a_286</span>getting into the stomach, and causing irritation in the stomach
and bowels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is not cramp sometimes a symptom of a violent bilious
attack?—Cramp often comes on in violent irritations of the
stomach and bowels, whatever may be the cause of that
irritation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is not cramp a certain symptom of a violent bilious attack?—It
very often accompanies it.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Cramp of the legs generally
arises from those causes?—Yes, my Lord; most frequently
from a violent action of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) Might it not arise from a bilious
disorganization of the stomach?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>This complaint of Cholera Morbus may proceed to a very
painful degree?—It may kill.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it a very painful complaint?—It is a very distressing
complaint.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as you have had an opportunity of visiting patients,
do you know it to be a painful complaint?—It produces
cramp, which is painful, and it certainly produces pain in the
stomach and bowels by its violent action.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you apprehend that a purgative medicine would be a
proper medicine for a person in that situation, supposing it
to have been Cholera Morbus?—There were no symptoms
of Cholera Morbus when I saw Mrs. Downing; but from
what I heard of her complaint, I imagined that there was
something offensive either in the stomach or bowels, which
ought to be evacuated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were ten drops of laudanum a proper thing to give her?—It
is sometimes given to allay the irritation of those parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Might not a powerful administration of laudanum be of
use in Cholera Morbus?—Seldom, I think, in large quantities,
but is given in small doses frequently, if the case be
urgent.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think you have stated, that the result of your chemical
experiment was not the production of any gross arsenic, or
arsenic in substance?—Not arsenic in substance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_287'>a_287</span>And you judged from the application of chemical tests?—Yes,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Be so good as to state what the chemical tests were which
you used?—The first was with the sulphate of copper,
which is the common blue vitriol. If you put a little carbonate
of potash into water containing a solution of arsenic,
and then add the sulphate of copper in solution, a <em>green</em>
precipitate will be produced; whereas, if no arsenic be
present, a <em>blue</em> precipitate would be formed: that was the
first test which I used.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was the second test?—The second test was with
the nitrate of silver, or common lunar caustic, (these are the
same in substance, but the lunar caustic is the more common
term). Put a little carbonate of potash into water containing
arsenic in solution, and dip the end of a cylindrical
piece of lunar caustic into the water, a <em>yellow</em> precipitate
will be produced; whereas if no arsenic be present, a <em>white</em>
precipitate would be formed. Those were the chief tests
which I used; but in order to ascertain whether any thing
which had been taken into the stomach, or was naturally
contained in it, would alter the appearances produced by
the tests, so as to make the result uncertain, I tried other
experiments. I concluded that bile formed part of the
contents of the stomach; I therefore procured some and
mixed it with water, and subjected it to the same tests in
the same manner, and I found that the appearance of the
precipitate was not the same as if arsenic were present; I
therefore inferred that bile, in the quantity in which it may
occasionally be found in the stomach, would not alter the
conclusion I had drawn from the result of my first experiments.—I
was informed that Mrs. Downing had eaten
onions; I boiled some in water in the usual way, and after
pouring off the water in which they were boiled, I poured
some boiling water on them, and let them stand for some
hours; I then ascertained what effect this water would
produce on the tests, and was satisfied that it would not,
when the experiment was carefully made, produce the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_288'>a_288</span>of arsenic.—I also understood that some tartarized
antimony had been given; I tried the tests with a solution
of that substance, and the precipitate had not the appearance
which arsenic, if present, would put on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you happen to know who was the first person who
discovered these tests?—I believe Mr. Hume discovered
that with nitrate of silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you know Dr. Marcett?—Yes, I know him from his
writings, to be a clever man.</p>

<p class='c000'>You don’t happen to know whether he first discovered
this mode?—No.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you know of any mode of managing any fluid substance,
in which arsenic has been mixed, so as to produce
arsenic in substance?—By evaporating the solution containing
arsenic, and by exposing it to heat in a close vessel, you
will produce it in a white solid state; and by mixing the
residuum of a solution of arsenic with an inflammable substance,
arsenic will be sublimed in its metallic state by the
same process.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of that experiment would not have deceived
any one in the world?—It would not certainly; but there
was such a small quantity left, after my other experiments,
that it was not tried.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have produced it, so that any person would know
the thing to be arsenic?—Certainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>You mix the fluid, in which the arsenic is, with an alkali,
when you seek to re-produce the mineral in substance? you
mix the solution with an alkali, don’t you?—No; there is
no occasion for an alkali.</p>

<p class='c000'>You put it in solution and expose it to heat?—If the
arsenic be in solution, it must be evaporated; and by doing
that which I have before stated with the residuum, it will
be produced in its metallic state.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the other tests, do you consider those as
conclusive and infallible?—Yes, in the way I used them.</p>

<p class='c000'>This business, of course, must have made a great bustle
in Falmouth, when people first talked about it?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_289'>a_289</span>When were you examined before the Coroner?—Upon
the same day of the funeral, and on the Thursday preceding.
I begged the inquest might be put off for two days, till I
had examined the contents of the stomach; and it was put
off for two days.</p>

<p class='c000'>You were examined, I believe, before you made the
analyses?—I remember that I was examined on the Thursday
as to the appearances I found on the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Can you recollect whether you did or did not state, before
the Gentlemen of the Jury, that the appearances of the
stomach were such as proceeded from a natural cause?—No,
certainly not.</p>

<p class='c000'>You did however desire that it might be postponed two
days, that you might make some experiments on the contents
of the stomach?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Are persons, particularly women, of an elderly time of life,
more subject to the attack of Cholera Morbus, than people
who are young?—There is very little difference.</p>

<p class='c000'>The age of the person does not predispose him or her more
to that complaint, than a youthful person?—No, I don’t
think it does; it is rather the contrary.</p>

<p class='c000'>You say there was nothing in the chamber vessel but water
that had been poured in, with which you had washed some
parts of the stomach?—I poured the water in myself, at a
time when I believe it was empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sergt. Pell—So that the effect of it would be only to
give more trouble in evaporating a greater quantity of fluid,
it having been made before.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>(Re-examined by Mr. Sergt. Lens.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>You have been asked several questions about the nature of
Cholera Morbus; do you change your opinion, in any respect,
as to this not being Cholera Morbus that occasioned
the death?—I do not.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have been asked particularly about a third test that
you did not make use of; I wish to ask you how it happened
that you did not resort to that test as well as to the others?—There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_290'>a_290</span>was not sufficient left so as to ascertain it accurately.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that that last test would not be so proper as the others?—The
tests I used would detect a more minute portion of
arsenic, and therefore were more proper for that occasion, as
I found that there could not be much arsenic in the fluid,
from the appearances produced by these tests.</p>

<p class='c000'>And that was the reason that you resorted to those tests
instead of this last test, which you did not use?—Yes, that
was the reason, when I found by the other tests that the
arsenic was not in a large quantity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had the quantity been larger, how would you have proceeded?—I
should have resorted also to the last if there
had been a larger quantity.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) The portion detected was very
small?—Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do I understand you to say that it was so small that you
did not think it fit to try the other test, or that of evaporation?—That
was my reason. I accounted for the smallness
of the quantity of poison in this way—from the frequent
throwing up, and the purging, which would carry off large
portions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose the contents of the stomach had been suffered to
remain in the jug as you had put them, unmixed with any
quantity of fluid, would it have been more easy to perform
the experiment, and securing its effect?—There would be
the same result, but a difference in regard to the length of
time that it would take to evaporate.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having tried and made use of these tests, would it
have been practicable still to have tried the test by evaporation
and sublimation?—I did not do it as the quantity of
fluid was so small, and I did not conceive that a small quantity
would do. If I had evaporated the whole of it in the
first place, I might perhaps have detected arsenic in substance;
but I had made use of a great quantity in trying the
other tests, which I threw away.</p>

<p class='c000'>That would not have been proper to have tried again, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_291'>a_291</span>which had been tried before?—It would not have been so
easily done.</p>

<p class='c000'>The application of the lunar caustic in the one instance,
and the sulphate of copper in the other, would not have
prevented the other operation?—It would not have been so
correct.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you happen to know that the prisoner, Mr. Donnall,
ever desired that any other test should be applied?—I don’t
recollect that he did; but some one came to my house, and
requested me to give him a part of the contents of the
stomach to try it, but I had none.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any application was made, it was too late?—Yes, my
Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was any person with you when you tried these tests?—Mr.
Street, a brother of the gentleman I have spoken of,
was with me.</p>

<p class='c000'>That is Mr. Samuel Spyvee Street?—Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any other person, at the other time of the experiments?—Mr.
John Street was present at the other.</p>

    <div><i>Mr. John Street</i> (examined by Mr. Gazelee).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>You were a surgeon?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long have you been retired from that profession?—About
five years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was any application made to you to attend the opening of
the body of Mrs. Downing?—Yes, Sir, there was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who applied to you?—Mr. Donnall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon what day did he apply to you?—Upon the
Thursday.</p>

<p class='c000'>To assist him in opening the body?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>What time did you go to the house?—Mr. Donnall called
upon me about half-past one o’clock upon the Thursday,
and I went to the house about two o’clock, or half-past two.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whom did you find there?—Mr. Donnall and Dr.
Edwards.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_292'>a_292</span>The operation was performed by Dr. Edwards?—Yes,
and I assisted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you remember the circumstance of the contents of the
stomach being taken out and put into a jug?—Yes, I do.</p>

<p class='c000'>What became of the jug, or was any thing said about it?—Dr.
Edwards poured the contents of the stomach into a jug,
and requested it should be taken particular care of, addressing
himself particularly to Mr. Donnall, who was very near
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that, did you proceed to examine the stomach itself?—We
did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Describe the appearances upon the stomach?—After
opening the stomach, I perceived it to be very much inflamed,
and remarked it to Dr. Edwards, and also to Mr.
Donnall, who was upon my right hand, that the inflammation
was very extensive, and the blood-vessels very turgid;
there were stars, and the villous coat very highly inflamed;
that was the appearance of the stomach; we then examined
the Duodenum, we found that very much inflamed; the
Jejunium and Illium we found but slightly inflamed; the
Cæcum was the next part that we opened, that was inflamed
but slightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Those are the parts of the
body connected with the stomach?—Yes; after that we
opened the chest to examine the heart, liver, and lungs, and
we found them in a perfect state.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Gazelee.) From those appearances, could you
form any judgment as to what was the occasion of the death
of the deceased?—From the appearances I should attribute
the death to some corrosive matter taken into the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>You found that the contents of the jug had been removed
into a chamber utensil, did you not?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>That chamber vessel was afterwards removed further in
under the bed?—Yes, Sir, by Dr. Edwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you and Dr. Edwards go out of the room together?—We
did, and Dr. Edwards remarked that he wished nobody
to go into the room when we were out of the way; he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_293'>a_293</span>this to Mr. Donnall, “You’ll observe that nobody is to go
into the room while we are away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Did you leave the prisoner
in the room!—No, my Lord; we all went down together.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Gazelee.) Dr. Edwards and you went over to
the town-hall together?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long did you remain there, till you returned?—About
three or four minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did the Jury come back with you?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you again go to the Town-hall?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long might you be absent the second time?—About
ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the expiration of those ten minutes, did you return to
the room for any, and what purpose?—I returned to the
room to do what was necessary to Mrs. Downing, and to put
her into the shell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you do any thing then?—I did; after putting Mrs.
Downing into the coffin, I told the servant to get me some
bottles, which she procured, and I then poured the contents
of the chamber utensil into a jug, and then into two bottles;
they filled both bottles; they were two quart bottles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you find any person in the room when you came back?—No
person.</p>

<p class='c000'>What became of the bottles?—I told the servant to deliver
them to Dr. Edwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>What is her name?—Susan Weeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gazelee—Her name is now O’Brien, having been
since married.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you see her go with them?—I saw her within a hundred
yards of Dr. Edwards’s house with the bottles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were you present when any of the tests spoken of by Dr.
Edwards were tried by that gentleman?—Yes, I saw him
try some of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Which of them did you see?—I
am not chemist enough to say; but I saw him try some,
and he told me before what would be the effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wish to ask you this question, whether arsenic may be
administered in a fluid state?—Yes, my Lord, it may.</p>

<p class='c000'>The usual way is in grains or in powder, but it may be
administered in a fluid state?—Yes, my Lord; it may be
dissolved in water and administered.</p>

<p class='c000'>May such a solution be made very strong?—If it be dissolved
in hot water it will contain a large portion; but if in
cold water it will not hold more than in the proportion of
one-eightieth part of the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you obtain a solution of arsenic, what quantity will
be contained in the hot water, or what quantity of that
water would be sufficient to occasion death?—I cannot say
exactly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two or three tea-spoonsful?—Very little more than that,
I should suppose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two dessert-spoonsful?—I dare say it would.</p>

<p class='c000'>A table-spoonful?—Yes, my Lord. If an alkali be dissolved
in the water first, it will hold a larger proportion in
solution; but if dissolved in the common way, I should
think a table-spoonful would be sufficient to produce death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was there any discharge from the nostrils, or any symptoms
of putrefaction?—None at that time: and as to the

take place early?—I never observed it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Dr. Adam Neale</i> (examined by Mr. Sergt. Pell).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I believe you are a physician at Exeter?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you, in the course of your medical experience, been
called upon to attend cases of Cholera Morbus?—Yes, frequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>From what cause, in general, does Cholera Morbus arise?—It
generally arises from putrid bile collected in the intestines,
which is thrown off by vomiting, and diarrhœa, or
purging.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it a disorder which is in its nature fatal?—It is the
most acute disease known in Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c000'>What do you mean by the term ‘acute’?—I mean by the
term acute, a disease which runs its course in the most rapid
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>What should be the usual course of attack of Cholera
Morbus as to duration, supposing the patient ultimately died
of it?—It very frequently kills the patient within twenty-four
hours, and if neglected or improperly treated, it kills
the patient in a much shorter period.</p>

<p class='c000'>What should you esteem a reasonable symptom of a
person of the age of 64 or 65 having this complaint? what
should you expect to find in a person with this complaint?—Constant
vomiting and purging, attended with pain in the
stomach and cramp in the legs.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_296'>a_296</span>In that state of the disorder, what should you prescribe?—I
should prescribe that the patient drink plentifully of any
warm fluid, such as mutton-broth or tea, and then I should
give a large dose of opium.</p>

<p class='c000'>Supposing you were called in to attend a woman with the
symptoms you have mentioned, whose pulse was frequent and
fluttering, what would you prescribe?—I should then give
her a large dose of opium, and I should repeat it at intervals,
until the retching, vomiting, and diarrhœa ceased, or till she
felt better.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall not trouble you, nor my Lord, by going through
the particular circumstances which Dr. Edwards has spoken
to, but merely ask you, had you the pleasure of hearing his
evidence?—I had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you hear distinctly the description he gave of the
appearance of the stomach, after it was opened?—I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>To what cause should you, independently of other circumstances,
have attributed those appearances?—To no cause
but the disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) What disease?—To the disease
of Cholera Morbus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you mean to say that they are indications of nothing
else?—No, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are indications of that disease as well as others?—Yes,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) Would Cholera Morbus have that
appearance?—I think so.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Did you ever see the body of
a person opened, who had died of Cholera Morbus?—I have
not, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) Have you had, in the course of
your practice, occasion to make experiments in chemistry?—Yes,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you hear the first experiment, or test, which Dr.
Edwards stated he had made, namely, that by the sulphate
of copper?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_297'>a_297</span>In your judgment, is that test an infallible test of arsenic
being present in solution?—By no means.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you heard of the other test which he tried, namely,
that by means of the nitrate of silver, or the lunar caustic?—I
have.</p>

<p class='c000'>What is your judgment of that species of test as to arsenic?—That
it is equally fallible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now as to the test with bile?—No [meaning, that test is
not infallible]: from the presence of phosphoric acid, the
same yellow-coloured precipitate will be thrown down, if
some lunar caustic be put into a solution of phosphate of
soda.</p>

<p class='c000'>What do you esteem to be a complete test of arsenic
being held in solution in any complicated body?—I don’t
conceive that there is any complete test, but the evaporating
of the solution, and reproducing the arsenic in its metallic
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you made any experiment upon any mixture,
through the medium of nitrate of silver, or the lunar caustic,
in which onions have been infused?—Yes, with a decoction
of onions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Be so good as to state particularly what that experiment
was which you made?—I made it within the last five days;
I made a decoction of onions, and added the carbonate of
potash together with the lunar caustic, and a pale yellow
cloud was produced; the liquor became opaque, and a cloud,
of a colour between white and yellow, or opal, or precious
stone colour, was produced.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Through the whole body?—Yes,
my Lord; I then varied the experiment and added to
it the phosphate of soda.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) After this opaline cloud had been
produced, what other effect had it?—It precipitated gradually;
there was a precipitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) This dark shade, or yellowish
white cloud, precipitated to the bottom?—Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_298'>a_298</span>Was that of the nature of what you call precipitation?—Yes,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) Well, Sir?—I added some solution
of phosphate of soda, and a solution of lunar caustic, and I
then obtained a yellow precipitate.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sergt. Lens.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I understood you to say that you never did, in point of
fact, examine the body of a person that died of Cholera
Morbus?—I never did; I only conclude, as a matter of
science, that such would be the appearance; but I never
did, in point of fact, open the body: I only conclude that
that would be the sort of inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, as to this decoction of onions, would one taking
rabbits smothered in onions be said to be taking a decoction?—The
juice of the onions would be conveyed into the stomach:
perhaps it would be as well to explain to the Court
what is my motive.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) We don’t want that: we only
want to know whether a decoction be the same as that which
would be conveyed by eating boiled onions?—The same
fluid would be conveyed into the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) That is, a decoction of onions?—Yes,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the greatest part is drawn off by the preparation?—Some
must infallibly remain. The experiment I made was,
by cutting an onion into various pieces, and putting it into
two wine-glassesful of water, and upon that decoction my
experiment proceeded—or by pouring boiling water over it,
or boiling it for two minutes, and then I tried the experiment
both with the liquid and with the boiled onion, and
the effects were the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that the small quantity that remained in the one case,
had the same effect as the extract in the other?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>That which is used at table must be considerably weaker
than that sort of preparation?—A considerable part, but
not the whole, otherwise the flavour would be all gone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_299'>a_299</span>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) In proportion as the strength
and flavour is diminished, so is the strength of the juice
diminished?—Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) Do you mean to say that that
mode [the test by evaporation] is absolutely an infallible
mode of detecting arsenic?—I speak by the practice of all
physicians, both at home and abroad, that it will be positively
detected by that mode to be present; but I don’t
mean to say that Dr. Edwards’s experiment won’t do it
also; but the phosphate of soda will produce the same
thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, if necessary to inquire as to the fact of its
presence, whether it be pursued by one or the other of
these modes, you would inquire into collateral circumstances?—Certainly;
but if you speak chemically, I should conceive
none decisive, without the reproduction of the metal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In your judgment, this is the best test that can be resorted
to?—I don’t speak from my own judgment merely, but
from acknowledged experiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is there any considerable portion of the phosphate of soda
in the bile?—Phosphoric acid exists in all the fluids of the
human body, in the blood and other fluids; I cannot say to
what degree it may exist, but it certainly does exist in these,
and in the bodies of all animals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Does it exist to such a degree in the human bile, as to
produce this effect?—I have not made the experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have not made any experiment, either in one way or
another?—It is necessary that I should mention that a
French chemist, named Denard, has published on this
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice Abbott.—We cannot take the fact from any
publication; we cannot take the fact as related by any
stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell, through Mr. Justice Abbott.) I
wish to know whether Dr. Neale, in the course of his practice,
has opened many bodies, the stomachs of which were
in a state of inflammation?—I have, a great many.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_300'>a_300</span>Were those appearances the same as described by Dr.
Edwards?—They were; I have seen many instances where
they were the same as described by Dr. Edwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>And that in cases in which there was no reason to suppose
that there was poison administered?—No reason whatever,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were you ever present at the opening of the body of a
person who was supposed to have died by poison?—I was
many years ago, when I was in Scotland, and when I was a
young man; but the appearances were not such as to satisfy
the medical men that there was arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is there any other substance, except this phosphate of
soda, that will throw down this yellow precipitate?—Not
that I am aware of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sulphate of copper was not an infallible test, you say;
explain that?—If sulphate of copper be contaminated with
iron, or be not pure; if it be mixed with the carbonate of
potash in solution, a yellow precipitate would be produced,
and the two colours will produce green. I should also state
that in mixing the solution, if the sulphate of copper should
be added to a decoction or an infusion of onions, with a
small quantity of the carbonate of potash, a green precipitate
is also produced; I have tried it repeatedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Supposing a person to have been eating boiled onions for
dinner, and in the course of the night to have been vomiting
or purging to a violent degree, would any particular portion
of the juice of the onion be left in the stomach?—Not in
the stomach in a great proportion; but I think that enough
may remain to affect the chemical test.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the mixture of the onions with other
food, there is sufficient to effect that in some degree?—Yes,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens, through Mr. Justice Abbott.) You
have stated that you have seen many bodies opened, in
which the stomach was in a state of inflammation, and in the
state described by Dr. Edwards, and yet no actual poison
present in those cases; what has been the state of the villous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_301'>a_301</span>coat of the stomach in such cases; have you attended to
that?—No, I have not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then you have only observed as to the inflammation and
so on, but not to the villous coat of the stomach?—Exactly
so, my Lord, and not to the villous coat of the stomach.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>You have been for many years a physician at Exeter?—Yes,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>And of considerable practice there?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you in your course of practice attended many persons
attacked with Cholera Morbus?—I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>What are the symptoms attendant upon that disorder?—Usually
considerable vomiting, affections of the bowels,
purging, pains of the stomach, great thirst, and cramps or
spasms of the legs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where you find a patient violently attacked by those
symptoms, what would be the medicines you would administer—I
should undoubtedly direct full doses of opium, to
remove the irritation, and to check the discharge.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you found a patient with a frequent and fluttering pulse,
should you so administer?—Most undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you heard the symptoms which Mrs. Downing is
described to have had the evening before her death?—Yes,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>(Cross-examined by Mr. Gazelee).</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Are these the symptoms of Cholera Morbus exclusively—No,
Sir; they are symptoms of arsenic, or any poison.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) Within what period of time
does Cholera Morbus usually produce death?—Within my
experience, I have seen it nearly fatal within fourteen hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within what time have you known it fatal?—I have never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_302'>a_302</span>known it fatal: I have known a patient in imminent danger
within fourteen hours, but he recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>In what way does that disease usually shew itself? does it
begin all at once, when the person is in good health, or
gradually?—I have known it rather sudden, after an illness
of an hour or two.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you ever known an instance of a person in good
health, eating a hearty dinner, and then sitting down to
tea, taken instantly with vomiting and purging in that way
described?—I have seen a case very similar to that.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you say very similar, will you be good enough to
explain that a little more?—It occurred in my practice
eight years ago, to see a gentleman who was seized with
sickness and nausea about five or six o’clock in the afternoon;
the sickness and nausea continued increasing till one
or two in the morning, and I was desired to see him; and
from two to four o’clock I considered him in such danger
that I had no hopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>That does not apply to my difficulty; I want to know
what the state of health of that patient would be—that is,
whether he would be troubled with a languor or illness,
which a person does not very well understand; or whether
that person would be, just before his being so seized with it,
in perfect good health?—That gentleman whom I mentioned
had been delicate in his health, but had had no positive
complaints.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cholera Morbus proceeds from bile?—From bile and
corrupt humours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Will they collect all at once?—They will shew themselves
collectively within a very short period of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have heard the symptoms and circumstances first described
by Dr. Edwards and Mr. Street?—Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the different facts which both those gentlemen have
spoken to, as to the state of the stomach of the deceased
when opened, what disorder should you have supposed that
person to have died of?—From some inflammation in the
stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>What disorder of the human frame, in your judgment,
would be likely to produce such appearances?—Hernia,
Cholera Morbus, and idiopathic inflammations, or inflammations
from unknown causes; that is, when we find those
appearances of the stomach where we can assign no causes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now supposing a person to have had violent retchings
and purgings, accompanied with a pain in the stomach, and
accompanied with such appearances as these in the stomach,
if the body had been opened to what causes would
you attribute it?—To Cholera Morbus, if I had not detected
Hernia.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) You mean to say that if you
had found the stomach in the state described by Dr.
Edwards, you would ascribe that to Cholera Morbus?—Yes,
my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) You have heard it stated in evidence
what the plan was that Mr. Donnall pursued, when
he administered medicine to Mrs. Downing that night?—I
have, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Was that the right or the wrong one?—It was partly
right, and partly wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_304'>a_304</span>In what respect was it right?—In the exhibition of
opium.</p>

<p class='c000'>In what respect was it wrong?—In giving any thing that
would increase the irritation that already existed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you seen the prescription which Dr. Edwards
wrote that night?—No, I have not; but I would wish to
see it—(<i>here the prescription alluded to was shewn to the
witness</i>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Now supposing a person to have retchings and purgings
for several hours, and that you found these attended with
frequent and fluttering pulse, in that state of the illness what
should you have prescribed?—I should have prescribed
diametrically opposite to the prescription of Dr. Edwards; I
should consider that prescribed by Dr. Edwards as adding
weight to a porter’s back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice Abbott (<i>to the witness</i>)—Don’t speak metaphorically;
you are speaking just now of a gentleman of
experience and respectability: I don’t wish you to conceal
your opinion, but only to speak it in different language.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Pell.) You should have pursued a method
diametrically opposite you say; now what is the course
pursued by that prescription?—There was irritation already
existing in the bowels, and that prescription, I conceive,
would tend to increase that irritation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides tending to increase the irritation, in your judgment
what other effect would be produced by it, in that
state of the person?—There was considerable debility or
exhaustion, and I should think <em>that</em> would increase that
debility and exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c000'>What should you have given?—I should have supported
the patient, and given opium in large doses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you had an opportunity of examining many bodies
after death?—A great many.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will ask you, did it ever in the course of your practice
happen to you to examine a body that had died of Cholera
Morbus?—I attended a patient, but I can state the reasons
why I did not do so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_305'>a_305</span>Don’t state the reasons why you did not. Then you
never did open any body that had died of Cholera Morbus?—Never.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have opened bodies after death?—Yes, Sir, a great
many.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cases of mere accident, where death has been produced
by violent injury arising from accident, have you
ever had occasion to ascertain the state of such a body as
that?—I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long ago?—Eight or nine years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was the accident that occasioned the death?—A
fractured skull.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long after the death was the body opened?—It was
either upon the second or the third day.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was the state of the stomach of that person?—Highly
vascular, which would lead any one unaccustomed
to the complaint, to mistake it as arising from inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now explain what you mean by the terms ‘highly vascular’?—The
congestion of numerous blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is there any thing as to the state of the hardness or softness
of the coats of the stomach, upon which any judgment
can rest?—I should suspect that as it is inflamed, the coats
of the stomach would be thickened and soft; for as the inflammation
takes place, the parts increase in size.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you examined the bodies of soldiers, or of any description
of persons, who have died of that complaint?—Yes,
I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>What would be the state, with respect to inflammatory
appearances in the stomach, of those subjects?—We generally
find the coats of the stomach red and thick; we very
often, but not always, find it where there is no reason whatever
to suspect inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you applied yourself to the study of chemistry very
much?—Not very much; but I have attended chemical
lectures.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you happen to know whether the chemical test through
the medium of nitrate of silver, or lunar caustic, is an infallible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_306'>a_306</span>one or not, as to shewing the presence of arsenic in
solution?—I conceive it not to be so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you recollect who it was that first proved this test?—I
don’t know who it was that proved it first; but the first
time I ever saw it described was in a medical publication by
Dr. Marcet, lecturer in Guy’s Hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you happen to know whether there be any thing else,
besides arsenic, which, if submitted to the lunar caustic,
would produce the same result as it would with arsenic?—I
do.</p>

<p class='c000'>What else?—If there be any alkaline phosphate, it would
put on the same appearance, and throw down the same
yellow precipitate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you know whether phosphoric acid and salts be contained,
or abound in the human frame?—I have been led to
believe so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you hear Dr. Edwards give his evidence as to the
test also of the sulphate of copper?—I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you made any experiments as to the sulphate of
copper?—I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have been told that the sulphate of copper, when
added to any liquid or fluid containing arsenic, will throw
down a green precipitate?—Yes, it will have that effect;
and I have made that experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you made any experiment in order to ascertain
whether any green precipitate would be thrown down by
sulphate of copper, when applied to any other solution than
that of arsenic?—I have tried it with an infusion of onions
and animal matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) What was the result?—A
green precipitate resembling that which would have been
thrown down, if arsenic had been present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did you happen to attend when Dr. Edwards was the
chemical lecturer at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, in London?—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_307'>a_307</span>was a student in the Borough, at St. Thomas’s and
Guy’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then you did not attend yourself, when Dr. Edwards was
the chemical lecturer at St. Bartholomew’s?—No, I did not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do we understand that you made those experiments previous,
or since this circumstance happened?—Both previous
to, and since this melancholy circumstance; and particularly
that with the nitrate of silver; and I thought it one of the
most delicate at the time I made it.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) That is the lunar caustic?—Yes,
my Lord. When I first made the experiment, about
three years ago, I found it the most delicate test of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'>What do you mean by the most delicate test of arsenic?—That
is, the smallest portion would be detected by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Sergt. Lens.) You found that at first?—Yes,
but I have since discovered its fallacy; and it was pointed
out by the same means which discovered its delicacy as a
test, because it is now ascertained that something else will
produce the same appearances.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have mentioned what?—Yes, any alkaline phosphates.</p>

<p class='c000'>I believe you are a physician at Plymouth?—I am.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have been present during the course of this trial, and
have heard the examination of Dr. Edwards?—I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have accordingly heard the tests that he applied to
the contents of the stomach of Mrs. Downing?—I have, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now I would ask you whether, in your judgment and experience,
those tests be or be not conclusive?—I am satisfied
that they are not.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I ask you whether or not they be conclusive, I
mean as to the existence of arsenic?—I am certain they are
not, and that they do not unequivocally shew the existence
of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_308'>a_308</span>Do the same results follow from experiments from other
compounds?—They do.</p>

<p class='c000'>What, in your judgment, is the proper test by which the
presence of arsenic would be discovered?—I am borne out
by all philosophical chemists in this country, in stating that
the only test that can bear a man out in swearing to its
presence is, the reproduction of the metal; I mean the
arsenic in its metallic state.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the other tests is the colour of the precipitate the only
thing by which to judge that arsenic is present?—In what
tests?</p>

<p class='c000'>The sulphate of copper for instance?—Unless it were
mixed with some carbonaceous matter, and submitted to the
action of heat: where that has not been done, it is the colour
only that has been relied on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you heard the appearances of the stomach as described
by Dr. Edwards?—I have.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do those appearances, in your judgment, indicate the
presence of arsenic in the stomach?—Although I should not
have drawn the conclusion that that body had therein received
poison, I certainly should have allowed such a
reflection to enter into my mind, and have acted upon it;
yet I by no means think (and I speak from the experience
of others), that the appearances stated to have existed were
such as <em>only</em> to denote the presence of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have you known the prisoner at the bar long?—Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long?—I only knew him at school; we were educated
together at the Exeter Free Grammar-school.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time, what was his character for humanity?—It
would be difficult to say what attaches one school-boy to
another; but I can say conscientiously——</p>

<p class='c000'>That is not the question. What was his character as a
school-boy?—That is a question which is difficult to answer—not
that I mean to imply that there was any thing to the
contrary of a good character, for I mean to say that he stood
high—he was respected by his school-fellows. We slept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_309'>a_309</span>together in the same dormitary; and I remember now with

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>You said that nothing but the reproduction of the arsenic
would satisfy your mind as to the presence of it?—It would
not; and I am borne out in that belief by the best authorities
in the country; nothing short of that would satisfy my mind
in swearing to its presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>(By Mr. Justice Abbott.) You said that the same results
would follow from other compounds?—Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>What other compounds would give the same result with
the lunar caustic?—Phosphoric acid.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what with the sulphate of copper?—Understanding
that the deceased had died after eating a hearty dinner of
rabbits and onions, I cut a large onion into slices, and took a
slice of raw meat, and put them into the same vessel, and
poured rather more than a pint of warm water upon the
mixture, with the view of making an infusion; I allowed it
to infuse for some hours; I then took a quantity of the
liquid or infusion so prepared, and I applied to it the same
tests:—first, the sub-carbonate of potash in solution, I then
added the sulphate of copper in solution, the two tests which
I understood Dr. Edwards had used.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what was the effect produced?—A green precipitate
was instantly formed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any thing else?—Yes, my Lord; with another portion

sub-carbonate of potash in solution, I then added the sub-nitrate

  <h2 id='aram' class='c008'>The Defence of <i>Eugene Aram</i>, for the murder of <i>Daniel Clarke</i>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>As this trial has excited very extraordinary interest, and
presents illustrations of several points connected with Medico-legal
investigations, we shall offer to our readers a brief
outline of the case, and introduce the ingenious defence
which the prisoner composed and read at his trial. In the
year 1745, Clarke, a shoemaker, at Knaresborough, in
Yorkshire, was induced by Eugene Aram and Richard
Houseman, to purchase a variety of valuable articles of plate
and jewellery, in consequence of having married a woman
who had many rich relations, and who, by an ostentatious display
of this kind, might conclude that Clarke was rich, and
in consequence of such belief make him their heir. No
sooner had Clarke yielded to the persuasion of these men,
and became in consequence possessed of many valuable
goods, than Eugene Aram and Houseman murdered him, in
February 1745, and buried his body in a field near the town,
and having shared Clarke’s treasure, they decamped.—Clarke
being at the time very much in debt, was supposed
to have gone abroad, and every inquiry ceased until the
year 1758, when a person, as he was digging for lime-stone
near St. Robert’s cave, found the bones of a human body,
upon which a conjecture arose that they were the remains of
Daniel Clarke, who it was presumed might have been murdered;
and as Houseman was seen in the company of Clarke
a short time before his disappearance, he was immediately
apprehended on suspicion, when having lost his self-possession
he imprudently exclaimed that <em>those</em> were not the bones
of Clarke, for they were buried in a different place! and
subsequently he stated the exact place where they were deposited,
and which were found accordingly. Soon after
Houseman was committed to the castle of York, it was discovered
that Aram resided in the character of a respectable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_312'>a_312</span>school-master at Lynn, in Norfolk, on which he was taken
into custody, and conveyed to York castle, where at the
following summer assizes they were tried; after Houseman
had given his evidence, and all such collateral testimony had
been received as could be adduced on such an occasion,
Aram delivered the following ingenious defence.</p>

<p class='c026'>“<i>My Lord</i>,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know not whether it is of right, or through some indulgence
of your Lordship, that I am allowed the liberty at
this bar, and at this time to attempt a defence, incapable
and uninstructed as I am to speak. Since, while I see so
many eyes upon me, so numerous and awful a concourse,
fixed with attention, and filled with, I know not what expectations,
I labour not with guilt, my Lord, but with perplexity.
For having never seen a court but this, being
wholly unacquainted with law, the customs of the bar, and
all judicial proceedings, I fear I shall be so little capable of
speaking with propriety in this place, that it exceeds my
hope if I shall be able to speak at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have heard, my Lord, the indictment read; wherein
I find myself charged with the highest crime, with an enormity
I am altogether incapable of, a fact, on the commission
of which there goes far more insensibility of heart, more
profligacy of morals, than ever fell to my lot. And nothing
possibly could have admitted a presumption of this nature,
but a depravity not inferior to that imputed to me. However,
as I stand indicted at your Lordship’s bar, and have
heard what is called evidence adduced in support of such a
charge, I very humbly solicit your Lordship’s patience, and
beg the hearing of this respectable audience, while I, single
and unskilful, destitute of friends, and unassisted by counsel,
say something perhaps like argument in my defence. I shall
consume but little of your Lordship’s time, what I have to
say will be short, and this brevity probably will be the best
part of it; however, it is offered with all possible regard,
and the greatest submission to your Lordship’s consideration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_313'>a_313</span>and that of this honourable court. First, my Lord, the
whole tenor of my conduct in life contradicts every particular
of this indictment. Yet had I never said this, did not
my present circumstances extort it from me, and seem to
make it necessary. Permit me here, my Lord, to call upon
malignity itself, so long and so cruelly busied in this prosecution,
to charge upon me any immorality, of which prejudice
was not the author. No, my Lord, I concerted no
schemes of fraud; projected no violence; injured no man’s
person or property; my days were honestly laborious; my
nights intensely studious. And I humbly conceive my notice
of this, especially at this time, will not be thought impertinent
or unseasonable, but at least deserving some attention,
because, my Lord, that any person, after a temperate
use of life, a sense of thinking and acting regularly, and
without one single deviation from sobriety, should plunge
into the very depth of profligacy, precipitately and at once,
is altogether improbable and unprecedented, and absolutely
inconsistent with the course of things. Mankind is never
corrupted at once, villany is always progressive, and declines
from right, step after step, till every regard of probity
is lost, and every sense of moral obligation totally perishes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Again, my Lord, a suspicion of this kind, which nothing
but malevolence could entertain, and ignorance propagate,
is violently opposed by my very situation at that time with
respect to health: for but a little space before I had been
confined to my bed, and suffered under a very long and severe
disorder, and was not able for half a year together so
much as to walk. The distemper left me indeed, yet slowly
and in part, but so macerated, so enfeebled that I was reduced
to crutches; and so far from being well about the
time I am charged with this fact, that I never to this day
perfectly recovered. Could then a person in this condition
take any thing into his head so unlikely, so extravagant?
I, past the vigour of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with
no inducement to engage, no ability to accomplish, no weapon
wherewith to perpetrate such a fact, without interest,
without power, without motive, without means.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_314'>a_314</span>“Besides, it must needs occur to every one, that an action
of this atrocious nature is never heard of, but, when its
springs are laid open, it appears that it was to support some
indolence, or supply some luxury; to satisfy some avarice,
or oblige some malice; to prevent some real, or some imaginary
want; yet I lay not under the influence of any one
of these. Surely, my Lord, I may consistent with both
truth and modesty affirm thus much; and none who have
any veracity and knew me, will ever question this. In the
second place, the disappearance of Clarke is suggested as an
argument of his being dead; but the uncertainty of such an
inference from that, and the fallibility of all conclusions of
such a sort, from such a circumstance, are too obvious and
too notorious to require instances; yet superseding many,
permit me to procure a very recent one, and that afforded
by this castle. In June 1757, William Thompson, for all
the vigilance of this place in open daylight and double ironed,
made his escape; and notwithstanding an immediate enquiry
set on foot, the strictest search and all advertisement,
was never heard of since. If then Thompson got off unseen
through all these difficulties, how very easy was it for Clarke,
when none of them opposed him? But what would be
thought of a prosecution commenced against any one seen
last with Thompson. Permit me next, my Lord, to observe
a little upon the bones which have been discovered. It is
said, which perhaps is saying very far, that these are the
skeleton of a man. It is possible indeed it may: but is
there any certain known criterion, which incontestably distinguishes
the sex in human bones? Let it be considered,
my Lord, whether the ascertaining of this point, ought not
to precede any attempt to identify them. The place of their
depositum too claims much more attention than is commonly
bestowed upon it; for, of all places in the world, none
could have mentioned any one, wherein there was greater
certainty of finding human bones than a hermitage, except
he should point out a church-yard; hermitages, in times
past, being not only places of religious retirement, but of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_315'>a_315</span>burial too. And it has scarce or never been heard of, but
that every cell now known contains or contained the relicts
of humanity, some mutilated and some entire. I do not inform,
but give me leave to remind your Lordship, that here
sat solitary sanctity, and here the hermit or the anchoress,
hoped that repose for their bones, when dead, they here enjoyed
when living. All the while, my Lord, I am sensible
this is known to your Lordship, and many in this court, better
than to me. But it seems necessary to my case that
others, who have not at all perhaps adverted to things of this
nature, and may have concern in my trial, should be made
acquainted with it. Suffer me then, my Lord, to produce a
few of many evidences, that these cells were used as repositories
of the dead, and to enumerate a few in which human
bones have been found as it happened in this question; lest
to some, that accident might seem extraordinary, and consequently
occasion prejudice.</p>

<p class='c000'>1st. The bones, as was supposed, of the Saxon St. Dubritius
were discovered buried in his cell at Guy’s Cliff near
Warwick, as appears from the authority of Sir. W. Dugdale.</p>

<p class='c000'>2d. The bones, thought to be those of the anchoress
Rosia, were but lately discovered in a cell at Royston, entire,
fair, and undecayed, though they must have lain interred
for several centuries, as is proved by Dr. Stukely.</p>

<p class='c000'>3d. But my own country, nay almost this neighbourhood,
supplies another instance, for in Jan. 1747 were found by
Mr. Stovin, accompanied by a rev. gentleman, the bones,
in part, of some recluse, in the cell at Lindholm near Hatfield.
They were believed to be those of William of Lindholm,
a hermit, who had long made this cave his habitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>4th. In Feb. 1744 part of Hoburn Abbey being pulled
down, a large portion of a corpse appeared, even with the
flesh on, which bore cutting with a knife; though it is certain
this had lain above 200 years, and how much longer
is doubtful, for this Abbey was founded in 1145, and dissolved
in 1538 or 9.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a_316'>a_316</span>“What would have been said, what believed, if this had
been an accident to the bones in question? Farther, my
Lord, it is not yet out of living memory, that a little distance
from Knaresborough in a field, part of the manor of the
worthy and patriot baronet, who does that borough the honor
to represent it in Parliament, were found in digging for gravel,
not one human skeleton only, but five or six, deposited
side by side, with each an urn placed at its head, as your
Lordship knows was usual in ancient interments. About the
same time, in another field, almost close to this borough,
was discovered also, in searching for gravel, another human
skeleton; but the piety of the same worthy gentleman ordered
both pits to be filled up again, commendably, unwilling
to disturb the dead. Is the invention of these bones
forgotten, then, or industriously concealed, that the discovery
of those in question may appear the more singular and
extraordinary? whereas, in fact, there is nothing extraordinary
in it. My Lord, almost every place conceals such
remains. In fields, in hills, in highway sides, in commons,
lie frequent and unsuspected bones. And our present
allotments for rest for the departed is but of some centuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Another particular seems not to claim a little of your
Lordship’s notice, and that of the gentlemen of the jury,
which is that perhaps no example occurs of more than one
skeleton being found in one cell; and in the cell in question
was found but one, agreeable in this to the peculiarity of
every other known cell in Britain. Not the invention of
one skeleton, but of two, would have appeared suspicious
and uncommon. But it seems another skeleton has been
discovered by some labourer, which was full as confidently
asserted to be Clarke’s as this. My Lord, must some of the
living, if it promotes some interest, be made answerable for
all the bones which earth has concealed and chance exposed?
and might not a place where bones lay, be mentioned by a
person by chance, as well as found by a labourer by chance?
or is it more criminal accidentally to name where bones lie,
than accidentally to find where they lie? Here too is a human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_317'>a_317</span>skull produced, which is fractured; but was this the
cause, or was it the consequence of death? was it owing to
violence, or was it the effect of natural decay? if it was
violence, was that violence before or after death? My
Lord, in May 1732 the remains of William Lord Archbishop
of this province, were taken up by permission, in this cathedral,
and the bones of the skull were broken, yet certainly
he died by no violence offered to him alive, that could
occasion that fracture there. Let it be considered, my
Lord, that upon the dissolution of religious houses, and the
commencement of the reformation, the ravages of those
times affected both the living and the dead. In search after
imaginary treasures, coffins were broken up, graves and
vaults dug open, monuments ransacked, and shrines demolished;
and it ceased about the beginning of the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. I entreat your Lordship, suffer not the
violence, the depredations, and the iniquities of those times
to be imputed to this. Moreover, what gentleman here is
ignorant that Knaresborough had a castle, which though
now a ruin, was once considerable both for its strength and
garrison? All know it was vigorously besieged by the arms
of Parliament, at which siege in sallies, conflicts, flights,
pursuits, many fell in the places round it, and where they
fell were buried, for every place, my Lord, is burial earth
in war; and many questionless of these, rest yet unknown,
whose bones futurity shall discover. I hope, with all imaginable
submission, that what has been said will not be
thought impertinent to this indictment; and that it will be
farther from the wisdom, the learning, and the integrity of
this place, to impute to the living, what fury in its zeal may
have done; what nature may have taken off and piety interred;
or what war alone may have destroyed, alone deposited.
As to the circumstances that have been raked together
I have nothing to observe, but that all circumstances
whatever are precarious, and have been but too frequently
found lamentably fallible; even the strongest have failed.
They may rise to the utmost degree of probability, yet they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a_318'>a_318</span>are but probability still. Why need I name to your Lordship
the two Harrisons recorded by Dr. Howel, who both
suffered upon circumstances, because of the sudden disappearance
of their lodger, who was in credit, had contracted
debts, borrowed money, and went off unseen, and returned
a great many years after their execution? Why name the
intricate affair of Jaques du Moulin under King Charles 2d,
related by a gentleman who was counsel for the crown?
and why the unhappy Coleman who suffered innocent,
though convicted upon positive evidence, and whose children
perished for want, because the world uncharitably believed
the father guilty? Why mention the perjury of Smith, incautiously
admitted king’s evidence, who to screen himself
equally accused Faircloth and Loveday of the murder of
Dun, the first of whom in 1749 was executed at Winchester,
and Loveday was about to suffer at Reading, had not
Smith been proved perjured to the satisfaction of the court,
by the Surgeon of Gosport hospital. Now, my Lord, having
endeavoured to shew that the whole of this process is altogether
repugnant to every part of my life, that it is inconsistent
with my condition of health about that time, that no
rational inference can be drawn, that a person is dead who
suddenly disappears, that hermitages were the constant repositories
of the bones of the recluse, that the revolutions in
religion or the fortune of war, has mangled or buried the
dead; the conclusion remains perhaps no less reasonably
than impatiently wished for. I at last, after a year’s confinement
equal to either fortune, put myself upon the candour,
the justice, and the humanity of your Lordship, and
upon yours, my countrymen, gentlemen of the jury.”</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. We have already alluded to such a cause of suffocation, (see p.
58 and 438.) The following instructive case has been transmitted to us
by <i>Mr. Alcock</i>, whose zeal and acumen in anatomical researches are as
honourable to himself, as they are useful to the profession of which he
is so active a member.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>Wm. Thompson</i>, æt. 36, formerly a soldier of the 27th regt. late a
watchman of St. James’s parish, had had three fits, stated to be epileptic,
within the last two years.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dec. 9th 1821, he was attacked by another fit, having the usual
character of epilepsy, which terminated fatally. In the morning he
appeared in his usual health, and had remarked to his wife that “he
was as well as ever he had been in his life.” He ate largely of pork,
with sage and onions, for dinner, about one o’clock. About five he
was rather unwell, and a little before six “went off in a fit.” He had
frequent convulsions “as rapidly as he could have them,” (his wife’s
statement) from the time he was taken ill till he died. There was no
sickness—no vomiting. He had lain upon his back for some time; he
was turned upon his side and suddenly expired. He never spoke from
the time of the attack till his death, A week previously he had complained
of head-ache, but not on the day of his illness. He was extremely
subject to flatulence. He did not cough at any time during the
attack which immediately preceded his death. For some years past he
had been unable to lie upon his right side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was largely bled from the arm; cold applications were freely
applied to the head, with some temporary mitigation of the convulsions.
Some medicines were directed, but as the state of insensibility in
which he was, precluded swallowing, it may be doubted whether they
ever reached his stomach. His pulse was full and frequent, but he was
too unsteady to allow it to be counted. The pupils were contracted to
points; but on the recurrence of the convulsions became widely dilated.
After the cold affusion over the head, and as the convulsions abated,
they gradually contracted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The examination of the morbid appearances was made, four days
after death, by <i>Mr. Alcock</i>, in the presence of <i>Mr. C. T. Haden</i>, surgeon,
and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>External appearances</i>, those of a very athletic, muscular subject. No
external appearance of injury. Slight shew of putrefaction on the abdominal
parietes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>The head</i> was carefully and minutely examined. The vessels of the
brain were distended with blood, but in no degree sufficient to explain
the cause of death. The brain was firm and natural in every part. The
choroid plexus of the right side was studded with a few small hydatid-like
vesicles. The spinal marrow, as far as could be seen through the
foramen magnum, was free from disease. The ventricles contained
about two fluid drachms of liquid, and about the same quantity was
found in the base of the skull when the brain was removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>The chest.</i> The right lung adhered universally, but its structure was
natural; the left lung was somewhat gorged with blood; no preternatural
adhesions. About from four to eight ounces of bloody fluid in
the left cavity of the chest. The heart was loaded with fat, and had on
the outer surface of the right ventricle a patch of lymph like a thin
layer of coagulated albumen. Several smaller spots of the same kind
on the right auricle; but none of them penetrated into the substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>Abdomen.</i> The liver adhered in numerous parts, and very extensively
to the peritoneum. The stomach was enormously large and distended
with food and air; the small intestines were also somewhat more distended
than usual, but exhibited no appearance of disease sufficient to
account for the death of the patient. The spleen was small and unhealthy,
having several white patches on its surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thus far no satisfactory explanation of the cause of death appeared.
And here, according to the usual mode of conducting examinations, the
investigation would have terminated, but I consider it essential in every
case to examine the air-passages. On examining the bronchiæ of the left
side, the principal ramifications and some of the smaller were filled with
a pultaceous substance of a dirty greenish hue and heterogenous texture,
resembling food which had undergone some degree of digestion: it
completely filled the left bronchia. The right bronchia and its ramifications
were quite filled with similar matter, and the trachea was also
completely filled at the lower part, so that breathing in such a state
must have been impossible. That the matter filling up the air passages
consisted of chyme from the stomach became evident, from its perfect
similarity to that which remained in the stomach.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the receipt of the above interesting communication from <i>Mr.
Alcock</i>, we have found upon an inquiry amongst the carcase butchers,
that the presence of food in the pulmonary passages is by no means a
rare occurrence in those animals that have been struck on the head.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. It was the custom of the ancients to exhibit in the same sculpture
in Bas relief, men of very different dimensions, of making kings and
conquerors gigantic in stature, while their subjects and vassals were
represented as only a fourth or fifth part of their size. This must have
given origin to the fable of Giants and Pigmies; while a belief in such
tales has been supported by the discovery of gigantic bones, which
have through ignorance been received as human remains, but which,
as <span class='sc'>Sir Hans Sloane</span> in an interesting paper in the <span class='sc'>Philosophical
Transactions</span> (No. 404, p. 497,) very truly observes, are nothing more
than the bones and teeth of Elephants or Whales: thus, says he, the
fore fin of a whale, stripped of its web and skin, was not long since
publicly shewn for the bones of a giant’s hand. The same explanation
applies to those pretended skeletons of Giants of 12, 20, and 30 cubits
high, as mentioned by <i>Philostratus</i>. The skeleton of 46 cubits which,
according to Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> <i>Lib.</i> vii. <i>c.</i> 16,) was found in the cavity
of a mountain in Crete, upon its overthrow by an earthquake. The
skeleton 60 cubits high which <i>Strabo</i> (Lib. 17) says was found near
Tangis (Tangier) in Mauritania, and supposed to be that of Antæus.
To which list maybe added the skeleton of Asterius, son of Anactes—10
cubits. That of Orestes, dug up by special command of the Oracle, 7
cubits, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

Camper</i> in the Academy of Drawing at Amsterdam, this celebrated
physiologist has shewn that in tracing the figures of the body of the
male and female in two imaginary ellipses of equal dimensions, a portion
of the pelvis of the latter would be out of the ellipse, and her
shoulders within it; whereas in the former, the shoulders would project
beyond the limits of the figure, and his pelvis, on the contrary, would
be entirely enclosed within it.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. <i>Sir M. Hale</i> (<i>1 P. C.</i> 433) says, it cannot be legally known whether
it were killed or not; and adds, “so it is if after such child were
born alive and <em>baptized</em>, and after dies of the stroke given to the mother,
this is not homicide.” It is difficult to conceive why the term <em>baptized</em>
was introduced in this dictum: for whether it were the child of Jew,
Turk, or Anabaptist, it is equally entitled to the protection of the law.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. The Roman Emperor, at a congress held at Constantinople in 692,

<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. The law of Scotland was yet more severe; the mere fact of concealing
the pregnancy, whether the death of the child were proved or
not, was a capital felony. See 1 <i>Hume’s Com.</i> 287, and 1 <i>Burnet’s Crim.

sense and meaning of a certain Act of Parliament made in England, in
the twenty-first year of the reign of his late Majesty King <i>James</i> the first,
intituled, <i>an act to prevent the destroying and murthering of bastard children</i>, and
also of a certain Act of Parliament, made in Ireland in the sixth year of
the reign of her late Majesty Queen <i>Anne</i>, intituled, <i>an act to prevent
the destroying and murthering of bastard children</i>; and the same have been
found in sundry cases, difficult and inconvenient to be put in practice;”
for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that, from and after the first day of July in the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and three, the said two several acts, and every
thing therein contained, shall be, and the same are hereby repealed; and
that, from and after the said first day of July, in the said year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and three, the trials in England and Ireland
respectively of women charged with the murder of any issue of
their bodies, male or female, which being born alive would by law be
bastard, shall proceed and be governed by such and the like rules of
evidence and of presumption as are by law used and allowed to take
place in respect to other trials for murder, and as if the said two several
acts had never been made.</p>

<p class='c000'>IV. Provided always, and be it enacted, that it shall and may be
lawful for the jury by whose verdict any prisoner charged with such
murder as aforesaid shall be acquitted, to find, in case it shall so appear
in evidence, that the prisoner was delivered of issue of her body, male or
female, which, if born alive, would have been bastard, and that she
did, by secret burying, or otherwise, endeavour to conceal the birth
thereof, and thereupon it shall be lawful for the court before which
such prisoner shall have been tried, to adjudge that the prisoner shall
be committed to the common gaol, or house of correction, for any time
not exceeding two years.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. The act provides that if any person or persons shall wilfully and
maliciously administer to, or cause to be administered to or taken by
any woman any medicines, drug or other substance or thing whatsoever,
or <i>shall use or employ or cause or procure to be used or employed,
any instrument or other means whatsoever</i> with intent thereby to cause
or procure the miscarriage of any woman not being or not being proved
to be quick with child at the time of administering such things, or using
such means, that then and in every such case, the person or persons so
offending, their counsellors, aiders, and abettors, knowing of and privy
to such offence, shall be and are hereby declared to be guilty of felony,
and shall be liable to be fined, imprisoned, set in and upon the pillory,
publicly or privately whipped, or to suffer one or more of the said punishments,
or to be transported beyond the seas for any term not exceeding
fourteen years, at the discretion of the court before which such
offender shall be tried and convicted.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. At the Chelmsford Assizes. Aug 1820, <i>Robin Collins</i> was indicted for
administering steel filings and penny-royal water to a woman, with the
intent to procure abortion. <i>Mr. Baron Wood</i> told the jury, in point of
law, that if they were satisfied that the prisoner had administered the
drugs with intent to procure miscarriage, though they were incapable
of producing such effect, and though the young woman had willingly
<em>consented</em> to take them, the case was within the statute, and they were
bound to find the prisoner guilty. The jury immediately found the
prisoner guilty. The learned judge expressed himself perfectly satisfied
with the verdict, and animadverted in strong terms on the enormity
and cruelty of the prisoner’s crime; public example required the severest
visitation of punishment that the law authorised, in order to warn
others against committing a similar crime, which unhappily was too
prevalent. The sentence of the Court was that the prisoner should be
transported for the term of fourteen years.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. Whereby it is enacted that “if any person shall wilfully, maliciously
and unlawfully administer to, or cause to be administered to or
taken by any of His Majesty’s subjects, any deadly poison or other
noxious and destructive substance or thing, with intent thereby to cause
and procure the miscarriage of any woman <em>then being quick with child</em>, the
offender shall suffer death as in cases of felony without benefit of
clergy.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. By the law of most countries this crime is punished with more severity
if committed after the <em>quickening</em> of the child, than before. The
Roman Penal Code made the same distinction. By the decretals of the
canon law (<i>p.</i> ii, <i>causs.</i> 32, <i>p.</i> ii, <i>c.</i> 8), “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est homicida, quæ abortum procurat,

<p class='c000'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. <i>Wm. Pizzy</i> and <i>Mary Codd</i> were tried at <i>Bury St. Edmonds</i>, Aug.
11, 1808, for feloniously administering a certain noxious and destructive
substance to <i>Ann Cheney</i>, with intent to produce a miscarriage. The
trial, taken in short hand by <i>Wm. Notcutt</i>, was published at <i>Ipswich</i> in
1808; but we have not been able to procure a copy; we must therefore
content ourselves with observing, on the authority of the <i>Med. Journ.</i>
that the Counsel for the prisoners objected to receiving that part of the
evidence which related to <i>Pizzy’s</i> manual operations upon <i>Ann Cheney</i>,
as not relevant to the administration of the medicines which alone constituted
the capital crime; the objection was over-ruled by the court,
and the evidence was admitted for the purpose of proving the <em>intention</em>
with which the medicines were administered. The examination of <i>Ann
Cheney</i> before the magistrates was as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Saith that she is about the age of 27 years; that she has lived as servant
with <i>Mr. Simon Codd</i>, of Haughley, about 12 years last past; that
she is an unmarried woman, and was so in the month of February 1806.
That in the said month of February 1806, she was delivered of a female
bastard child; that she was alone when she was delivered, but that she
called out for assistance, but no one came for some minutes; the child
was born dead; she never saw it move, or heard it make a noise. That
soon after she found herself with child, she acknowledged it to her mistress,
<i>Codd</i>, and told her who was the father of the child. Her mistress
said, if she would take that which she would get for her, she thought
she could order it better than letting any body know it. Soon after
that, she saw <i>Mr. Pizzy</i> of Middlesham, the farrier; she told him
what was the matter with her; he then gave her some more medicines,
and told her they were to make her miscarry. They had not that
effect; that she continued to take medicines from him during her whole
remaining time of pregnancy; she sometimes received them from her
mistress, and sometimes from <i>Pizzy</i>; that her mistress knew what they
were for, because she (her mistress) had told her what they were for;
that the medicines did not answer the intended purpose; that about a
week or ten days before she was delivered, <i>Mr. Pizzy</i> came, and upon
her informing him that his medicines had not answered the purpose, he
said she must go up stairs with him, which she did; they were alone;
he laid her on the floor, on a great coat, upon her back; she put the
coat over her head, so that she could not see; she then felt him put
some instrument up into her body, which was very cold, like iron; but
she did not see it; that, in consequence, she lost some blood, not very
much nor very little—suppose about half a pint; did not feel much
pain. <i>Pizzy</i> told her it was for the purpose of making her miscarry.
Her mistress was at home, and knew for what purpose they went up
stairs, but was not present. <i>Pizzy</i> came again the day before she was
brought to bed. Examinant told him she had not miscarried; he then
said he must try something further; her mistress was present, and
heard this. <i>Pizzy</i> and examinant went up stairs again, but her mistress
was not present. <i>Pizzy</i> laid her down, as he did before, on her back,
and passed his hand three times up into her body half way of his arm,
which was naked, which gave her a great deal of pain; and this examinant
felt herself very wet, and never felt the child move afterwards.
Examinant thinks she had not gone her time by six or seven weeks. She
felt the child move after she was so first treated by <i>Pizzy</i>, and till
within a day or two before the second time. She thinks she did not go
her full time, from the treatment she received from <i>Pizzy</i>.”</p>

utero-gestation has generally been rated too high; apparently from this
having been stated from conjecture, rather than from the evidence of
the balance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears from the observations of <i>Dr. Hunter</i>, made at the British
Lying-in hospital, on the bodies of several thousand new-born and
perfect children, that the weight of the smallest was about <i>four pounds</i>;
and of the largest <i>eleven pounds two ounces</i>; that of by far the greater proportion
was from <i>five to eight pounds</i>. <i>Dr. Clarke’s</i> inquiries furnished
nearly similar results; he found that the average weight of male children
was <i>seven pounds five ounces and seven drachms</i>; and that of female, <i>six
pounds eleven ounces and six drachms</i>, (Phil. Trans. vol. lxxiv.) <i>Dr. Clark</i>, of
Dublin, found it vary from <i>four</i> to <i>eleven pounds</i>. <i>Dr. Merriman</i> states,
in his lectures, that he delivered one which weighed <i>fourteen pounds</i>, (it
was born dead,) and <i>Dr. Croft</i> delivered one alive weighing <i>fifteen
pounds</i>. It is somewhat less in France than in England; of fifteen hundred
and forty-one examined by <i>Camus</i>, under circumstances similar to
the foregoing, the greatest weight was <i>nine pounds</i>, and of this there
were sixteen instances; the ordinary, from <i>five</i> to <i>seven</i>; and the average
<i>six pounds and about a quarter</i>; there were thirty-one instances in which
it was as low as <i>three pounds</i>, although <i>Baudelocque</i> states that he saw several
instances in which the weight was about <i>ten pounds</i>, a few where
it was <i>twelve</i>, and one of <i>thirteen</i>. Subsequent observations on twenty
thousand children at the Hospice de la Maternité, at Paris, have shewn
a few instances where it has been <i>one hundred and sixty-eight ounces</i>, that is
<i>ten pounds and a half</i>, which has been the highest term. In Germany it
appears to be nearly the same as in France; for <i>Roederer</i> states the average
weight to be from <i>five pounds</i> to <i>six pounds and a half</i>.—<i>Hutchinson,

<p class='c000'><a href='#r92'>92</a>. At Bury assizes 1748, <i>William York</i>, a boy of ten years of age,
was convicted before Lord Chief Justice <i>Willes</i> for the murder of a girl
of about five years of age, and received sentence of death: but the
Chief-Justice, out of regard to the tender years of the prisoner, respited
execution, till he should have an opportunity of taking the opinion of
the rest of the judges, whether it was proper to execute him or not,
upon the special circumstances of the case, which he reported to the
judges at Serjeant’s-inn in Michaelmas term following.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy and girl were parish children, put under the care of a parishioner,
at whose house they were lodged and maintained; on the
day the murder happened, the man of the house and his wife went out
to their work early in the morning, and left the children in bed together;
when they returned from work, the girl was missing; and the
boy being asked what was become of her, answered that he had helped
her up and put on her cloaths, and that she was gone he knew not
whither. Upon this, strict search was made in the ditches and pools of
water near the house, from an apprehension that the child might have
fallen into the water. During this search, the man, under whose care
the children were, observed, that a heap of dung near the house had
been newly turned up; and upon removing the upper part of the heap,
he found the body of the child about a foot’s depth under the surface,
cut and mangled in a most barbarous and horrid manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this discovery, the boy, who was the only person capable of
committing the fact that was left at home with the child, was charged
with the fact, which he stiffly denied.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the coroner’s jury met, the boy was again charged, but persisted
still to deny the fact. At length, being closely interrogated, he
fell to crying, and said he would tell the whole truth. He then said,
that the child had been used to foul herself in bed; that she did so that
morning (which was not true, for the bed was searched and found to be
clean); that thereupon he took her out of the bed, and carried her to
the dung heap; and with a large knife, which he found about the house,
cut her in the manner the body appeared to be mangled, and buried her
in the dung heap; placing the dung and straw that was bloody under
the body, and covering it up with what was clean; and having so
done, he got water and washed himself as clean as he could.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy was the next morning carried before a neighbouring justice
of the peace, before whom he repeated his confession, with all the circumstances
he had related to the coroner and his jury. The justice of
the peace very prudently deferred proceeding to a commitment, until
the boy should have an opportunity of recollecting himself. Accordingly
he warned him of the danger he was in if he should be thought
guilty of the fact he stood charged with, and admonished him not to
wrong himself: and then ordered him into a room, where none of the
crowd that attended should have access to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the boy had been some hours in this room, where victuals and
drink were provided for him, he was brought a second time before the
justice, and then he repeated his former confession: upon which he
was committed to gaol.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the trial evidence was given of the declarations before-mentioned
to have been made before the coroner and his jury, and before the justice
of the peace; and of many declarations to the same purpose which
the boy made to other people after he came to gaol, and even down to
the day of his trial; for he constantly told the same story in substance,
commonly adding that the devil put him upon committing the fact.
Upon this evidence, with some other circumstances tending to corroborate
the confessions, he was convicted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this report of the Chief-Justice, the judges, having taken time
to consider it, unanimously agreed,</p>

<p class='c000'>1st, That the declarations stated in the report were evidence proper
to be left to the jury.</p>

<p class='c000'>2dly, That supposing the boy to have been guilty of this fact, there
are so many circumstances stated in the report, which are undoubtedly
tokens of what my Lord Chief-Justice <i>Hale</i> somewhere calleth a <em>mischievous
discretion</em>, that he is certainly a proper subject for capital punishment,
and ought to suffer; for it would be of very dangerous consequence
to have it thought, that children may commit such atrocious
crimes with impunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many crimes of the most heinous nature, such as in the present
case the murder of young children, poisoning parents or masters,
burning houses, <i>&amp;c.</i> which children are very capable of committing;
and which they may in some circumstances be under strong temptations
to commit; and therefore, though the taking away the life of a boy
of ten years old may savour of cruelty, yet as the example of this boy’s
punishment may be a means of deterring other children from the like
offences; and as the sparing this boy, <em>merely on account of his age</em>, will
probably have a quite contrary tendency, in justice to the public, the
law ought to take its course; unless there remaineth any doubt touching
his guilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this general principle all the judges concurred: but two or three of
them, out of great tenderness and caution, advised the Chief-Justice to
send another reprieve for the prisoner; suggesting that it might possibly
appear on farther inquiry, that the boy had taken this matter upon himself
at the instigation of some person or other, who hoped by this artifice
to screen the real offender from justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly the Chief-Justice did grant one or two more reprieves;
and desired the justice of the peace who took the boy’s examination, and
also some other persons in whose prudence he could confide, to make
the strictest inquiry they could into the affair, and report to him. At
length he, receiving no farther light, determined to send no more reprieves,
and to leave the prisoner to the justice of the law at the expiration
of the last: but, before the expiration of that reprieve, execution
was respited till farther order, by warrant from one of the Secretaries
of State: and at the Summer assizes 1757, he had the benefit of his
Majesty’s pardon, upon condition of his entering immediately into the
sea-service.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f104'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r104'>104</a>. Cases of mistaken identity have occurred more frequently than
persons unacquainted with the subject could suppose. We shall relate a
few instances. At the Old Bailey sessions, for September 1822, before
the Common Serjeant and Middlesex Jury, <i>Joseph Redman</i> was indicted
for assaulting <i>William Brown</i>, on the King’s highway, and taking from
his person a gold watch, &amp;c. his property. Prosecutor stated, on cross-examination,
that he knew a man of the name of <i>Greenwood</i>, so much
like the prisoner, with his hat on, that he should hardly know one from
the other. <i>Greenwood</i> was in custody, and appeared at the bar, when
the similarity between them struck every body with astonishment. The
prisoner, <i>Redman</i>, proved an <i>alibi</i>, and the jury returned a verdict of
<i>not guilty</i>. We have frequently in the preceding parts of our work alluded
to the case of <i>Richard Coleman</i>, a brewer’s clerk, who was indicted
at the assizes held at Kingston, in Surry, in March 1749, for the rape
and murder of <i>Sarah Green</i> on the 23d of July preceding, when he was
capitally convicted, and executed on Kennington Common, on the 12th
of April 1749. In this case, <i>Coleman</i> was positively sworn to by <i>Sarah
Green</i>, just before her death, as being one of the assailants. Two years
after the execution of this unfortunate man, it was discovered that <i>James
Welch</i>, <i>Thomas Jones</i>, and <i>John Nicholls</i>, were the persons who had treated
<i>Sarah Green</i> in the inhuman manner which had occasioned her death.
<i>John Nicholls</i> was admitted King’s evidence, and <i>Welch</i> and <i>Jones</i> were
accordingly convicted and executed. Another case in which the identity
of a person was erroneously sworn to, was that of <i>Mr. James</i>, a
tailor, who was robbed on the Dulwich road, by the notorious gang of
highwaymen that infested the environs of London, and was headed by
a person named <i>Cooper</i>, who, after a life of crime, suffered death for
the murder of <i>Saxby</i>, near Dulwich. In this case <i>Mr. James</i> swore positively
to two soldiers in the Guards, who were accordingly tried for
the offence, but, fortunately, acquitted. A short time after this event
the same gang robbed one <i>Jackson</i>, a farmer, in a lane near Croydon,
for which robbery two farriers, named <i>Skelton</i> and <i>Killet</i>, were apprehended,
and being tried at the ensuing assizes for Surry, the latter was
acquitted, but the former was convicted on the positive oath of the person
robbed, and, although innocent, suffered death.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Martin Clinch</i>, bookseller, and <i>James Mackley</i>, printer, were tried at
the Old Bailey, in 1797, before <i>Mr. Justice Grose</i>, for the wilful murder
of <i>Syder Fryer, Esq.</i> at the back of Islington workhouse, and were convicted
and executed. On this occasion the identity of the prisoners was
positively sworn to by <i>Miss Ann Fryer</i>, who was in company with her
cousin, the deceased, at the time of the robbery and murder. Some
years afterwards <i>Burton Wood</i>, who was executed on Kennington common,
and <i>Timms</i>, who suffered a similar fate at Reading, severally confessed
at the gallows the commission of the deed, for which <i>Clinch</i> and
<i>Mackley</i> had innocently suffered. To the above interesting cases we may
add that of <i>Robert</i> and <i>Daniel Perreau</i> (twin brothers,) who were tried in
1775, and executed for a forgery upon <i>Mr. Adair</i>. These persons so
nearly resembled each other that <i>Mr. Watson</i>, a money scrivener, who
had drawn eight bonds, by order of one or other of the brothers, hesitated
to fix on either, in consequence of their great personal resemblance;
upon being pressed, however, to make a positive declaration,
he at length fixed upon <i>Daniel</i>. The name of these unfortunate men is
familiar to the public, from the well known exclamation of our late
king, upon being asked to pardon <i>Dr. Dodd</i>, “if I <i>save Dodd</i>, I shall
have <em>murdered</em> the <i>Perreaus</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the subject of personal identity, a curious question has presented
itself for discussion, which requires some notice on this occasion—<i>the
degree of light which may be necessary to enable an observer to distinguish the
features, so that the person maybe hereafter identified</i>? In a case which occurred
in France in 1809, of a person shot in the night, it was stated
that the flash of the pistol enabled the witness to identify the features of
the assassin. The possibility of the statement was referred to the physical
class of the Institute, who reported against it. Still, however, <i>M.
Foderé</i>, who relates the circumstances, is inclined to believe that, if the
persons be at a small distance, and the night be dark, such an event is
by no means impossible. (<i>Med. Leg.</i> t. i, p. 28.) The following English
case may be here introduced in illustration of the question. “<i>John Haines</i>
was indicted, <i>January 12, 1799</i>, for maliciously and feloniously shooting
at <i>H. Edwards</i>, <i>T. Jones</i>, and <i>T. Dowson</i>, Bow-street officers, on the highway.
<i>Edwards</i> deposed that, in consequence of several robberies having
been committed near Hounslow, he, together with <i>Jones</i> and <i>Dowson</i>,
were employed to scour that neighbourhood; and that they accordingly
set off in a post-chaise on the evening of Saturday, November
10th, when they were attacked near Bedfont by two persons on horseback,
one of whom stationed himself at the head of the horses, while
the other went to the side of the chaise. The night was dark, but <em>from
the flash of the pistols</em> he could distinctly see that it was a dark-brown
horse, between 13 and 14 hands high, of a very remarkable shape, having
a square head, and very thick shoulders; and, altogether such that
he could pick him out of fifty horses; he had seen the horse since at <i>Mr.
Kendall’s</i> stables, in Long Acre. He also perceived, <em>by the same flash of
light</em>, that the person at the side-glass had on a rough-shag, brown great
coat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Writers on forensic medicine have enumerated the various circumstances,
by which the countenance of an individual may be so changed,
as to defeat every attempt to identify him. <i>Foderé</i> mentions the following,
<i>age; loss, or acquisition of fat; change in the colour of the eyes or hair;
the effects of climate, diet, diseases, and passions of the mind</i>. These may also be
metamorphosed by art. The influence of mental anxiety in changing
the countenance is universally acknowledged—</p>

may entertain angry feelings towards offenders, is not the most proper

<p class='c000'><a href='#r175'>175</a>. Dr. <i>Stanger</i> had before made an unsuccessful application to this
Court. He had obtained a rule calling on the president and fellows of
the college to shew cause why a mandamus should not issue “commanding
them to admit him to examination for admission into the class
or order of candidates for election into the society or fellowship of the
said college.” But as Dr. <i>Stanger</i> had presented himself to the <i>comitia
minora</i> to be examined, which court is constituted by one of the bye-laws
with power only to examine candidates of a certain description
within which Dr. <i>Stanger</i> did not come, this Court in <i>Easter</i> term 1796
discharged the rule for the mandamus; saying that it did not appear
that Dr. <i>Stanger</i> had a right to be examined by the <i>comitia minora</i>; but
that if he had any title as being one of the <i>homines facultatis</i> under the
charter, he should apply to the body at large. The Court also intimated
at that time a strong opinion that the bye-laws were reasonable and
valid.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r179'>179</a>. In the close of the first book of <i>Paulus Zacchias’s famous Quæstiones
Medicolegales</i>, there is a full discussion of the point of filiation, as between
two husbands, where a woman soon after the death of her first husband
marries a second. The question is raised in these words. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Filius mulieris,
quæ illico ab obitu conjugis alteri nupsit, et novem decemve mensium spatio
peperit; cujusdam præsumi debeat.</span></i>” See Paul. Zacch. lib. 1. tit. 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quæstio
ultima</span></i>. The same point is investigated in the learned treatise by Alphonsus
a Caranza, De Partu Naturali et Legitimo. See cap. 26. s. 71. The
first book of Paulus Zacchias, who was a physician at Rome, first came
out in 1621. The tract by Alphonsus a Caranza was first published
about five years afterwards.</p>

court of Friesland. The author was <i>Johannes a Sande</i>, who was himself
a senator of that court. An improved edition of the book came out in
1656. The particular case above cited was adjudged 27th October,
1617. What increases the latitude of the decision for the legitimacy is,
that the husband was for some time a valetudinarian, and for 14 days
before his death confined to his bed. The book being probably rare
amongst English lawyers, and the arguments in the case comprising
very ancient and curious research in a moderate compass on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimum
tempus pariendi</span></i> for women, the whole of Sande’s report of the case will
be given in a note at the end of the present article.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
